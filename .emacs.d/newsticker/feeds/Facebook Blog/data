I founded Facebook on the idea that people want to share and connect with people in their lives, but to do this everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times.

"html")) "<p>I founded Facebook on the idea that people want to share and connect with people in their lives, but to do this everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times.</p><p> </p><p>This idea has been the core of Facebook since day one. When I built the first version of Facebook, almost nobody I knew wanted a public page on the internet. That seemed scary. But as long as they could make their page private, they felt safe sharing with their friends online. Control was key. With Facebook, for the first time, people had the tools they needed to do this. That's how Facebook became the world's biggest community online.  We made it easy for people to feel comfortable sharing things about their real lives.</p><p> </p><p>We've added many new tools since then: sharing photos, creating groups, commenting on and liking your friends' posts and recently even listening to music or watching videos together. With each new tool, we've added new privacy controls to ensure that you continue to have complete control over who sees everything you share. Because of these tools and controls, most people share many more things today than they did a few years ago.</p><p> </p><p>Overall, I think we have a good history of providing transparency and control over who can see your information.</p><p> </p><p>That said, I'm the first to admit that we've made a bunch of mistakes. In particular, I think that a small number of high profile mistakes, like Beacon four years ago and poor execution as we transitioned our privacy model two years ago, have often overshadowed much of the good work we've done.</p><p> </p><p>I also understand that many people are just naturally skeptical of what it means for hundreds of millions of people to share so much personal information online, especially using any one service.  Even if our record on privacy were perfect, I think many people would still rightfully question how their information was protected. It's important for people to think about this, and not one day goes by when I don't think about what it means for us to be the stewards of this community and their trust.</p><p> </p><p>Facebook has always been committed to being transparent about the information you have stored with us – and we have led the internet in building tools to give people the ability to see and control what they share.  </p><p> </p><p>But we can also always do better. I'm committed to making Facebook the leader in transparency and control around privacy.</p><p> </p><p>As we have grown, we have tried our best to listen closely to the people who use Facebook. We also work with regulators, advocates and experts to inform our privacy practices and policies. Recently, the US Federal Trade Commission established agreements with Google and Twitter that are helping to shape new privacy standards for our industry. Today, the FTC announced <a href=\"http://ftc.gov/opa/2011/11/privacysettlement.shtm\">a similar agreement with Facebook</a>. These agreements create a framework for how companies should approach privacy in the United States and around the world.</p><p> </p><p>For Facebook, this means we're making a clear and formal long-term commitment to do the things we've always tried to do and planned to keep doing -- giving you tools to control who can see your information and then making sure only those people you intend can see it.</p><p> </p><p>In the last 18 months alone, we've announced more than 20 new tools and resources designed to give you more control over your Facebook experience. Some of the things these include are:</p><p> </p><p>• An easier way to <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150251867797131\">select your audience</a> when making a new post</p><p>• <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434691727130\">Inline privacy controls</a> on all your existing posts</p><p>• The <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150251867797131\">ability to review tags</a> made by others before they appear on your profile</p><p>• <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150278932602131\">Friend lists</a> that are easier to create and that maintain themselves automatically</p><p>• A <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130\">new groups product</a> for sharing with smaller sets of people</p><p>• A tool to view your profile as someone else would see it</p><p>• Tools to ensure your information stays secure like <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150153272607131\">double login approval</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=413846952130\">Mobile versions</a> of your privacy controls</p><p>• An easy way to download all your Facebook data</p><p>• A <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434691727130\">new apps dashboard</a> to control what your apps can access</p><p>• A <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=403443752130\">new app permission dialog</a> that gives you clear control over what an app can do anytime you add one</p><p>• Many more <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=381246352130\">privacy education resources</a></p><p> </p><p>As a matter of fact, privacy is so deeply embedded in all of the development we do that every day tens of thousands of servers worth of computational resources are consumed checking to make sure that on any webpage we serve, that you have access to see each of the sometimes hundreds or even thousands of individual pieces of information that come together to form a Facebook page. This includes everything from every post on a page to every tag in those posts to every mutual friend shown when you hover over a person's name. We do privacy access checks literally tens of billions of times each day to ensure we're enforcing that only the people you want see your content. These privacy principles are written very deeply into our code.</p><p> </p><p>Even before the agreement announced by the FTC today, Facebook had already proactively addressed many of the concerns the FTC raised. For example, their complaint to us mentioned our Verified Apps Program, which we canceled almost two years ago in December 2009. The same complaint also mentions cases where advertisers inadvertently received the ID numbers of some users in referrer URLs. We fixed that problem over a year ago in May 2010.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to these product changes, the FTC also recommended improvements to our internal processes. We've embraced these ideas, too, by agreeing to improve and formalize the way we do privacy review as part of our ongoing product development process. As part of this, we will establish a biennial independent audit of our privacy practices to ensure we're living up to the commitments we make.</p><p> </p><p>Even further, effective today I am creating two new corporate officer roles to make sure our commitments will be reflected in what we do internally -- in the development of our products and the security of our systems -- and externally -- in the way we work collaboratively with regulators, government agencies and privacy groups from around the world:</p><p> </p><p>- Erin Egan will become Chief Privacy Officer, Policy. Erin recently joined Facebook after serving as a partner and co-chair of the global privacy and data security practice of Covington & Burling, the respected international law firm. Throughout her career, Erin has been deeply involved in legislative and regulatory efforts to address privacy, data security, spam, spyware and other consumer protection issues. Erin will lead our engagement in the global public discourse and debate about online privacy and ensure that feedback from regulators, legislators, experts and academics from around the world is incorporated into Facebook's practices and policies.</p><p> </p><p>- Michael Richter will become Chief Privacy Officer, Products. Michael is currently Facebook's Chief Privacy Counsel on our legal team. In his new role, Michael will join our product organization to expand, improve and formalize our existing program of internal privacy review. He and his team will work to ensure that our principles of user control, privacy by design and transparency are integrated consistently into both Facebook's product development process and our products themselves.</p><p> </p><p>These two positions will further strengthen the processes that ensure that privacy control is built into our products and policies. I'm proud to have two such strong individuals with so much privacy expertise serving in these roles.</p><p> </p><p>Today's announcement formalizes our commitment to providing you with control over your privacy and sharing -- and it also provides protection to ensure that your information is only shared in the way you intend. As the founder and CEO of Facebook, I look forward to working with the Commission as we implement this agreement. It is my hope that this agreement makes it clear that Facebook is the leader when it comes to offering people control over the information they share online.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, I also want to reaffirm the commitment I made when I first launched Facebook. We will serve you as best we can and work every day to provide you with the best tools for you to share with each other and the world. We will continue to improve the service, build new ways for you to share and offer new ways to protect you and your information better than any other company in the world.</p>")) (entry nil (title nil "Introducing Facebook for iPad") (id nil "http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150311269432131") (link ((rel .

Since then, over a million people have signed up for the developer beta to access Timeline. The feedback we've received so far has been invaluable. Starting today, we are making Timeline more widely available as we measure speed and other types of performance. We'll begin by making it available to people in New Zealand and then roll it out more broadly in the near future.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Originally Published on Thursday, September 22, 2011: </em></strong></p><p>Since the beginning of Facebook, your profile has been the place where you tell your story. People use it to share everything from the small stuff, like their thoughts on an article, to the most important events of their lives, like the photos of their wedding or the birth of their child.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The evolution of your profile</strong></p><p> </p><p>Back in the early days of Facebook, your profile was pretty basic – just your name, a photo, where you went to school…stuff you'd cover in the first five minutes you met someone.</p><p> </p><p><photo id=\"1\" /></p><p> </p><p>Over time, your profile evolved to better reflect how you actually communicate with your friends. Now you can can share photos of what you did last weekend, and updates about how you feel today.</p><p> </p><p>But since the focus is on the most recent things you posted, more important stuff slips off the page. The photos of your graduation get replaced by updates about what you had for breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>Say you're catching up with an old friend – would you rather find out that they had eggs this morning, or hear about their new dream job?</p><p> </p><p>The way your profile works today, 99% of the stories you share vanish. The only way to find the posts that matter is to click \"Older Posts\" at the bottom of the page. Again. And again.</p><p> </p><p><photo id=\"2\" /></p><p> </p><p>Imagine if there was an easy way to rediscover the things you shared, and collect all your best moments in a single place.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Introducing timeline – a new kind of profile</strong></p><p> </p><p>With timeline, now you have a home for all the great stories you've already shared. They don't just vanish as you add new stuff.</p><p> </p><p><video id=2203694005397></video></p><p> </p><p>Timeline is wider than your old profile, and it's a lot more visual.  The first thing you'll notice is the giant photo right at the top. This is your cover, and it's completely up to you which of your photos you put here.</p><p> </p><p>As you scroll down past your cover, you'll see your posts, photos and life events as they happened in time. You choose what's featured on your timeline. You can star your favorites to double their size or hide things altogether.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Filling in the blanks</strong></p><p> </p><p>If important parts of your story aren't included on your timeline, you can go back to when they happened and add them.</p><p> </p><p><photo id=\"3\" /></p><p> </p><p>Or go to your private activity log. This is where you'll find everything you shared since you joined Facebook. Click on any post to feature it on your timeline so your friends can see it, too.</p><p> </p><p><photo id=\"4\" /></p><p> </p><p><strong>Add apps to your timeline</strong></p><p> </p><p>Introducing a new kind of social app that lets you show the things you like to do on your timeline – the music you listen to, the recipes you try, the runs you take and more.</p><p> </p><p><video id=2203714645913></video></p><p> </p><p>These apps also help you discover what your friends are up to. You can even join in if you want: play the song they're listening to, or watch the same TV show.</p><p> </p><p>You can start adding some of these new apps today, but <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/about/timeline\">timeline</a> won't be available for a few weeks.</p><p> </p><p>When you get your timeline, you can choose to publish it immediately or take a few days to review what's there and add anything that's missing.</p><p> </p><p>Now, you and your friends will finally be able to tell all the different parts of your story – from the small things you do each day to your biggest moments.

Last week, we announced improvements to <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150278932602131\">Friend Lists</a> and a new <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150280039742131\">Subscribe button</a> to help you see more of what you care about, and less of what you don't.</p><p> </p><p>But it's not just the people you hear from that make your News Feed interesting. It also matters how much you visit Facebook. If you haven't returned in a week, you may want to see a summary of top stories first. If you've already visited several times that day, you probably care more about recent news.</p><p> </p><p>Starting today, it will be easier to keep up with the people in your life no matter how frequently or infrequently you're on Facebook.</p><p> </p><p><strong>News Feed: See What Matters at the Top </strong></p><p> </p><p>When you pick up a newspaper after not reading it for a week, the front page quickly clues you into the most interesting stories. In the past, News Feed hasn't worked like that.  Updates slide down in chronological order so it's tough to zero in on what matters most.  </p><p> </p><p>Now, News Feed will act more like your own personal newspaper. You won't have to worry about missing important stuff. All your news will be in a single stream with the most interesting stories featured at the top. If you haven't visited Facebook for a while, the first things you'll see are top photos and statuses posted while you've been away. They're marked with an easy-to-spot blue corner.</p><p> </p><p><photo id=\"4\" /></p><p> </p><p>If you check Facebook more frequently, you'll see the most recent stories first. Photos will also be bigger and easier to enjoy while you're scrolling through.</p><p> </p><p><photo id=\"5\" /></p><p> </p><p><strong>Ticker: Join Friends in Real-Time </strong></p><p> </p><p>News Feed often has a time lag. Usually when you're on Facebook, a lot of your friends are too. Until now, there hasn't been an easy way to see and chat with your friends about photos, articles, and other things they're posting in real-time. The new ticker helps you do just that.</p><p> </p><p>Ticker shows you the same stuff you were already seeing on Facebook, but it brings your conversations to life by displaying updates instantaneously. Now when a friend comments, asks a question or shares something like a check in, you'll be able to join the conversation right away. Click on anything in ticker to see the full story and chime in – without losing your place.</p><p> </p><p><photo id=\"7\" /></p><p> </p><p>If you have a wider screen, slide the grey bar between ticker and chat up or down to adjust how many updates you see at a time. To control who can see your updates anywhere on Facebook, including in ticker and News Feed, adjust your <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/about/sharing\"> sharing control</a> or <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy&amp;ref=mb\">apps settings</a>.</p><p> </p><p>We hope these improvements make your conversations on Facebook more lively, no matter how often you visit.

When I built the first version of Facebook, almost nobody I knew wanted a public page on the internet. That seemed scary. But as long as they could make their page private, they felt safe sharing with their friends online. Control was key. With Facebook, for the first time, people had the tools they needed to do this. That's how Facebook became the world's biggest community online.  We made it easy for people to feel comfortable sharing things about their real lives.</p><p> </p><p>We've added many new tools since then: sharing photos, creating groups, commenting on and liking your friends' posts and recently even listening to music or watching videos together. With each new tool, we've added new privacy controls to ensure that you continue to have complete control over who sees everything you share. Because of these tools and controls, most people share many more things today than they did a few years ago.</p><p> </p><p>Overall, I think we have a good history of providing transparency and control over who can see your information.</p><p> </p><p>That said, I'm the first to admit that we've made a bunch of mistakes.

I'm committed to making Facebook the leader in transparency and control around privacy.</p><p> </p><p>As we have grown, we have tried our best to listen closely to the people who use Facebook. We also work with regulators, advocates and experts to inform our privacy practices and policies.

Today, the FTC announced <a href=\"http://ftc.gov/opa/2011/11/privacysettlement.shtm\">a similar agreement with Facebook</a>.
