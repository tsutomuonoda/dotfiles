Then assign each behavior as a negative or positive behavior. You can also use ClassDojo for tracking attendance. Once you have created your class lists and selected behaviors to track actually tracking behaviors is quite easy.</p><p>To track your students&#8217; behaviors in ClassDojo just sign-in, select your class, and start marking student names with positive or negative points. When you mark with positives or negatives you can state the reason by selecting from the menu of behaviors that you created while creating your ClassDoJo lists. You can use your computer or your mobile device to make entries in your ClassDoJo account. Students can view their records by signing into their records through secret <a href=\"http://www.classdojo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ClassDoJo</a> codes assigned to them. Parents can have reports about their children sent to them by you.</p><p>For ideas on using ClassDojo in your classroom, I recommend reading <a href=\"http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2013/02/using-class-dojo-to-motivate-your.html\" target=\"_blank\">Using ClassDojo to Motivate Students</a> which Terri Eichholz wrote on <a href=\"http://freetech4teachers.com\" target=\"_blank\">Free Technology for Teachers</a>.</p><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='550' height='309' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KaeNSYJvrn0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Android4Schools/~4/LT6JQZB5_aU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.android4schools.com/2013/02/28/classdojo-launches-an-android-app/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://www.android4schools.com/2013/02/28/classdojo-launches-an-android-app/")) (item nil (title nil "SAT Word A Day – A Free Vocabulary App for Android") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Android4Schools/~3/axPnTsGg3lc/") (comments nil "http://www.android4schools.com/2013/02/27/sat-word-a-day-a-free-vocabulary-app-for-android/#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 00:43:14 +0000") (dc:creator nil "admin") (category nil "College") (category nil "High School") (category nil "free apps") (category nil "SAT") (category nil "vocabulary") (category nil "vocabulary apps") (guid ((isPermaLink .
