However, the Nexus 7 has superior specifications to the Kindle Fire, giving it a more attractive feature set that may make it more desirable to consumers.”</p><p>The materials of the 8GB Nexus 7 version cost $151.75 or $159.25 after the manufacturing costs are added to the sum. The 16GB Nexus 7 version on the other hand costs $159.25 or $166.75 including manufacturing overheads.</p><p>“Like Apple, Google has realized it can boost margins by offering more memory at a more profitable price point,” IHS iSuppli said. “Google is charging $50 more at retail for only $7.50 in additional memory cost at the BOM level. This adds $42.50 to Google’s bottom line on each sale of the high-end model.”</p><p>IHS iSuppli reported in November that the materials cost of the Kindle Fire including manufacturing is $201.70, meaning that Amazon was selling the Kindle Fire at a loss by pricing it at $199. Now the Kindle Fire materials cost has been reduced to $133.80, not including manufacturing expenses, thanks to the decline in component pricing. “These considerable cost reductions provide a breather for Amazon in terms of the subsidy it initially paid to penetrate the market,” IHS iSuppli said today.</p><p>Via : <a title=\"Forbes\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/connieguglielmo/2012/07/11/google-should-break-even-on-nexus-7-tablet-at-152-to-build-ihs-isuppli-says/\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nexustabletcentral/~4/iIFvLVO19kQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.nexustabletcentral.com/2012/07/13/ihs-isuppli-report-shows-nexus-7-costs-152-to-build-small-profit-for-google/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://www.nexustabletcentral.com/2012/07/13/ihs-isuppli-report-shows-nexus-7-costs-152-to-build-small-profit-for-google/")) (item nil (title nil "Nexus 7 updated to Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nexustabletcentral/~3/aJ2yZiYKILs/") (comments nil "http://www.nexustabletcentral.com/2012/07/13/nexus-7-updated-to-android-4-1-1-jelly-bean/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 13 Jul 2012 22:32:41 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Bogdan Goie") (category nil "Nexus 7 Tablet Apps") (category nil "Nexus 7 Tablet News") (category nil "Android") (category nil "Android 4.1.1") (category nil "Google Tablet") (category nil "Jelly Bean.")
