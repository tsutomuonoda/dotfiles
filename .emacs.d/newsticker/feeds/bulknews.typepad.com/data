<p>JJ introduced his own&nbsp;<a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~jonallen/App-cpackage-1.00/\" target=\"_self\">cpackage</a>&nbsp;module, which is <em>extremely </em>similar to what we do in carton or <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/OrePAN/\" target=\"_self\">OrePAN</a>&nbsp;do, i.e. rebuilds the mirror index based on the archives you downloaded with cpanminus, and then bundle cpanm itself into a self-contained perl script you can execute on a remote server.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~penfold/\" target=\"_self\">Penfold</a>&nbsp;gave a quick tour for \"best practice\" of getting your own Perl with <a href=\"http://perlbrew.pl/\" target=\"_self\">perlbrew</a>, install modules with cpanm and deploy with carton.</p>
<p>In addition to all of this, I presented the proposal on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanfile\" target=\"_self\">cpanfile</a>, which is an extracted version of Module::Install's DSL to represent <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Meta::Prereqs\" target=\"_self\">CPAN::Meta::Prereqs</a>. This is still a proposal, but it will be trivial to implement on upcoming cpanm and Carton releases, and this would make declaring and managing CPAN dependencies in your Perl application much easier.</p>

Amazon probably doesn't want to give users a control on this, and for the most use case of this device, such as Video, Music, Games and Books, the screen should be always on, and yet Amazon wants to give this device a better battery life when not used. Otherwise, Android's battery won't get as long as iPad when WiFi is on.") (p nil "While charging, there's no actual sign of percentage of the battery.

The screen scrolls pretty fast and rendering on reading apps and videos are really smooth. With the help of server side rendering with Silk (see below), i see almost no issues with performance on this device.") (h3 nil "Video") (p nil "I am a Amazon Prime customer and now can access lots of streaming video content. It works really well, the streaming quality is pretty good and the screen is beautiful.

(h2 nil "Third party apps") (p nil "Third party apps are available through Amazon appstore. It allows side-loading applications (.apks), so if you're geek enough to root your phone and extract .apks out there, you can probably install more apps that are not available on Amazon store.")

It means most apps that requires the framework doesn't just work, even if you install the APKs.")

(p nil "In my opinion the device is still better than most of Android tablets out there in the market, and $199 price tag can't be beaten so easily - yet, it is far, far behind iPad, even the original iPad.")
