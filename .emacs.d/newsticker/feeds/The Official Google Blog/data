<br />
Today 30 new partners are joining the <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/\">Google Art Project</a>, contributing nearly 2,000 diverse works including contemporary art from <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/museo-de-arte-contemporaneo-de-bogota/\">Latin America</a>, ancient art from <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/hunan-provincial-museum/\">China</a>, rare <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/yamatane-museum/\">Japanese</a> paintings and Palaeolithic flint heads from <a href=\"http://googleartproject.com/collection/museo-de-altamira/\">Spain</a>.<br />
<br />
One highlight of the new collection is a <a href=\"http://googleartproject.com/collection/sao-paulo-street-art/\">project</a> to capture the growing trend of urban art and graffiti in Brazil. More than 100 works from walls, doors and galleries in São Paulo have been photographed and will be included in the Art Project. The pieces were chosen by a group of journalists, artists and graffiti experts and include artists such as <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/sao-paulo-street-art/artwork/untitled-speto/34232047/\">Speto</a>, <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/sao-paulo-street-art/artwork/untitled-kobra/34122557/\">Kobra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/sao-paulo-street-art/artwork/sp24-invader/33439090/\">Space Invader</a>, as well as images of São Paulo’s most famous building-size murals. You can see the contrast in styles in the <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/artworks/compare/29509745/33915110/\">Compare</a>&nbsp;tool and&nbsp;image below.<br />

<br />
Photography features strongly in the works our partners are bringing online this time around. The <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/fundacion-mapfre/\">Fundacion MAPFRE</a> in Spain showcases one of the largest collections with more than 300 photos from a number of renowned photographers. For example, you can explore Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide’s black and white <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/fundacion-mapfre/artwork/volantin-san-martin-tilcajete-oaxaca-mexico-graciela-iturbide/29665185/\">images</a> of indigenous Mexican culture inspired by themes of ritual, death and feminism.<br />
<br />
The Art Project is also becoming a home to rare and precious items which move beyond paintings. <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/museum-of-literature-petofi/\">Petőfi Literary Museum</a> in Hungary has contributed the Nemzeti Dal or “<a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/museum-of-literature-petofi/artwork/national-song-sandor-petofi/31773251/\">National Song</a>,” a Hungarian poem which is said to have been the inspiration for the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The original document has rarely been seen in public to prevent humidity and light fading the script further. Online now for the first time, it can be explored by anyone in the world.<br />
<br />
With 40,000+ artworks to explore from more than 200 museums in more than 40 countries, we look forward to seeing these new works feature in hundreds of thousands of user galleries you have created to date. Keep an eye on our <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+GoogleArtProject/posts\">Google+ page</a> for more details about the new collections.<br />

Usually we grab a pad of sticky-notes, scribble a reminder and put it on the desk, the fridge or the relevant page of a magazine. Unfortunately, if you’re like me you probably often discover that the desk, fridge or magazine wasn’t such a clever place to leave the note after all...it’s rarely where you need it when you need it.<br />
<br />
To solve this problem we’ve created Google Keep. With Keep you can quickly jot ideas down when you think of them and even include checklists and photos to keep track of what’s important to you. Your notes are safely stored in Google Drive and synced to all your devices so you can always have them at hand.<br />
<br />
If it’s more convenient to speak than to type that’s fine—Keep transcribes voice memos for you automatically. There’s super-fast search to find what you’re looking for and when you’re finished with a note you can archive or delete it.<br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UbvkHEDvw-o\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />
<br />
Changing priorities isn’t a problem: just open Keep on your Android phone or tablet (there’s a widget so you can have Keep front and center all the time) and drag your notes around to reflect what matters. You can choose the color for each note too.<br />
<br />
Pro tip: for adding thoughts quickly without unlocking your device there's a lock screen widget (on devices running Android 4.2+).<br />

<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep\">Google Keep</a> is available on Google Play for devices running Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich and above.

We thought it would be fun to demonstrate this new technology by using an old one: silent film.<br />
<br />
<a href=\"http://peanutgalleryfilms.com/\">The Peanut Gallery</a> lets you add <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertitle\">intertitles</a> to old black-and-white movie clips just by talking out loud while you watch them. Create a film and share it with friends, so they can bring out their inner screenwriters too.  <br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hd8HzLCIstE\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />

We hope that developers will find many uses for the Web Speech API, both fun and practical—including new ways to navigate, search, enter text, and interact with the web. We can’t wait to see how people use it.<br />

If you’re like me, the list is pretty long—to be honest I’d be lucky to get to all of mine. Google Maps has a bucket list too, and today we’re checking off a couple of our favorites so we can make our map more comprehensive and share it with you. And if tall mountains are your thing, you’re in luck. <br />
<br />
Now you can explore some of the most famous mountains on Earth, including Aconcagua (South America), Kilimanjaro (Africa), Mount Elbrus (Europe) and Everest Base Camp (Asia) on Google Maps. These mountains belong to the group of peaks known as the Seven Summits—the highest mountain on each of the seven continents. While there’s nothing quite like standing on the mountain, with Google Maps you can instantly transport yourself to the top of these peaks and enjoy the sights without all of the avalanches, rock slides, crevasses, and dangers from altitude and weather that mountaineers face. <br />
<br />
Start your adventure on Tanzania’s Mount Kilimanjaro, the dormant volcano known as the Roof of Africa. See amazing views of the highest freestanding mountain in the world covered in snow just three degrees south of the equator.<br />

"html")) "For decades, the World War II codebreaking centre at Bletchley Park was one of the U.K.’s most closely guarded secrets. Today, it’s a poignant place to visit and reflect on the achievements of those who worked there. Their outstanding feats of intellect, coupled with breakthrough engineering and dogged determination, were crucial to the Allied victory—and in parallel, helped kickstart the computing age.  <br />
<br />
We’ve long been keen to help <a href=\"http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/653670\">preserve</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15739984\">promote</a> the importance of Bletchley Park. Today we’re announcing two new initiatives that we hope will bring its story to a wider online audience. <br />
<br />
First, we’re welcoming the <a href=\"http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/\">Bletchley Park Trust</a> as the latest partner to join <a href=\"http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/home\">Google’s Cultural Institute</a>. Their <a href=\"http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/bletchley-park-home-of-the-codebreakers/wRANFg9s\">digital exhibit</a> features material from Bletchley’s archives, providing a vivid snapshot of the work that went on cracking secret messages and the role this played in shortening the war. Included are <a href=\"http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/eastcote-greek-bombe-bay/IwFMzU3CqbYPkA\">images of the Bombe machines</a> that helped crack the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine\">Enigma code</a>; and of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/colossus-10-with-attending-wren/RgEMNv8jzlAFEA\">Colossus</a>, the <a href=\"http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2012/03/remembering-colossus-worlds-first.html\">world’s first programmable electronic computer</a>, used to crack the German High Command code—including <a href=\"http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/d-day-double-cross-message/fQG2elVwb2rEtg\">this message</a> showing the Germans had been successfully duped about the location for the D-Day invasion.  <br />
<br />
<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">
<a href=\"http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/bletchley-park-home-of-the-codebreakers/wRANFg9s\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"341\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-728NZzP7Wz0/UUDsxjfsEVI/AAAAAAAAMDE/tQ7BYBncbto/s640/1fBHWK5KbWbP_FYU01FVAF4It2dpscZrMZEK49Q.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>
<br />
Second, as a followup to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knXWMjIA59c\">our film about Colossus</a>, we’re pleased to share a personal story of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe\">the Bombe</a>, as told by one of its original operators, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Valentine_(bombe_operator)\">Jean Valentine</a>.  Women like Jean made up the majority of Bletchley Park’s personnel—ranging from cryptographers, to machine operators, to clerks. In her role operating the Bombe, Jean directly helped to decipher messages encoded by Enigma. In this film Jean gives us a firsthand account of life at Bletchley Park during the war, and demonstrates how the Bombe worked using a replica machine now on show at the museum.  <br />

Everyone has a device, sometimes multiple devices. It’s been a long time since we have had this rate of change—it probably hasn’t happened since the birth of personal computing 40 years ago.  To make the most of these opportunities, we need to focus—otherwise we spread ourselves too thin and lack impact.  So today we’re announcing some more closures, bringing the total to 70 features or services closed since our <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/fall-spring-clean.html\">spring cleaning began</a> in 2011:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Apps Script </b>will be deprecating the <b>GUI Builder</b> and <b>five UiApp widgets</b> in order to focus efforts on <a href=\"http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2012/06/big-updates-for-apps-script.html\">Html Service</a>. The rest of the Ui Service will not be affected. The GUI Builder will continue to be available until September 16, 2013. For more information see <a href=\"http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/03/retiring-a-few-apps-script-components.html\">our post</a> on the Google Apps Developer Blog.</li>
<li><b><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/caldav\">CalDAV API</a> </b>will become available for whitelisted developers, and will be shut down for other developers on September 16, 2013. Most developers’ use cases are handled well by <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/\">Google Calendar API</a>, which we recommend using instead. If you’re a developer and the Calendar API won’t work for you, please fill out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/19gOLSlkTzHi-zub3BkMv7Ot0JMLPj4YSxJUBseGAMSg/viewform\">this form</a> to tell us about your use case and request access to whitelisted-only CalDAV API.</li>
<li><b>Google Building Maker</b> helped people to make three-dimensional building models for Google Earth and Maps. It will be retired on June 1, but users are still able to access and export their models from the 3D Warehouse. We’ll continue to expand the availability of comprehensive and accurate <a href=\"http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/06/take-flight-through-new-3d-cities-on.html\">new 3D imagery on Google Earth</a>, and people can still use <a href=\"http://support.google.com/mapmaker/answer/2802405?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2802453\">Google Map Maker</a> to add building information such as outlines and heights to Google Maps.</li>
<li><b>Google Cloud Connect </b>is a plug-in to help people work in the cloud by automatically saving Microsoft Office files from Windows PCs in Google Drive. But <a href=\"http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?answer=3017040\">installing Google Drive</a> on your <a href=\"http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2375078\">desktop</a> achieves the same thing more effectively—and Drive works not only on Windows, but also on Mac, Android and iOS devices. Existing users will no longer be able to use Cloud Connect as of April 30.</li>
<li>We launched <b>Google Reader</b> in 2005 in an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites. While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader. Users and developers interested in RSS alternatives can export their data, including their subscriptions, with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1#custom:reader\">Google Takeout</a> over the course of the next four months.</li>
<li>Beginning next week, we're ending support for the <b>Google Voice App for Blackberry</b>. For Blackberry users who want to continue using Google Voice, we recommend they use our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/m?uipref=1\">HTML5 app</a>, which is more secure and easier for us to keep up to date.  Our HTML5 site is compatible with users with Blackberry version 6 and newer.</li>
<li>We’re deprecating our <b><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-search/\">Search API for Shopping</a></b>, which has enabled developers to create shopping apps based on Google’s Product Search data. While we believe in the value this offering provided, we’re shifting our focus to concentrate on creating a <a href=\"http://adwords.blogspot.com/2012/05/building-better-shopping-experience.html\">better shopping experience</a> for users through Google Shopping. We’ll shut the API down completely on September 16, 2013.</li>
<li>Beginning today we’ll no longer sell or provide updates for <b>Snapseed Desktop for Macintosh and Windows</b>. Existing customers will continue to be able to download the software and can <a href=\"http://www.niksoftware.com/support/usa/entry.php\">contact us</a> for support. We’ll continue to offer the Snapseed mobile app on iOS and Android for free.</li>
</ul>
<br />
These changes are never easy.  But by focusing our efforts, we can concentrate on building great products that really help in their lives.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Update</b> March 15, 2013</i>: We worked with the developers who provide 98 percent of our current CalDAV traffic to assure access to the CalDAV API, which means many popular products will not be impacted. We remain committed to supporting open protocols like CalDAV.  <br />

He believed that aligning standards around an open-source operating system would drive innovation across the mobile industry. Most people thought he was nuts. But his insight immediately struck a chord because at the time it was extremely painful developing services for mobile devices. We had a closet full of more than 100 phones and were building our software pretty much device by device. It was nearly impossible for us to make truly great mobile experiences.        <br />
<br />
Fast forward to today. The pace of innovation has never been greater, and Android is the most used mobile operating system in the world: we have a global partnership of over 60 manufacturers; more than 750 million devices have been activated globally; and 25 billion apps have now been downloaded from Google Play. Pretty extraordinary progress for a decade’s work. Having exceeded even the crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for Android—and with a really strong leadership team in place—Andy’s decided it’s time to hand over the reins and start a new chapter at Google. Andy, more moonshots please!<br />
<br />
Going forward, Sundar Pichai will lead Android, in addition to his existing work with Chrome and Apps.  Sundar has a talent for creating products that are technically excellent yet easy to use—and he loves a big bet. Take Chrome, for example. In 2008, people asked whether the world really needed another browser.  Today Chrome has hundreds of millions of happy users and is growing fast thanks to its speed, simplicity and security. So while Andy’s a really hard act to follow, I know Sundar will do a tremendous job doubling down on Android as we work to push the ecosystem forward.  <br />
<br />
Today we’re living in a new computing environment. People are really excited about technology and spending a lot of money on devices. This is driving faster adoption than we have ever seen before. The Nexus program—developed in conjunction with our partners Asus, HTC, LG and Samsung—has become a beacon of innovation for the industry, and services such as Google Now have the potential to really improve your life. We’re getting closer to a world where technology takes care of the hard work—discovery, organization, communication—so that you can get on with what makes you happiest… living and loving. It’s an exciting time to be at Google.  <br />

<a href=\"http://www.google.com/diversity/women/our-inspiration/index.html\">Women were some of the first programmers</a> and continue to make a major impact on the programming world today. We think it’s&nbsp;important to highlight the great work women are doing in computer science, to help provide role models for young women thinking about careers in computing.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow is <a href=\"http://www.internationalwomensday.com/\">International Women’s Day</a>, and as one of our contributions to the celebration, we’re proud to support <a href=\"http://www.globaltechwomen.com/voices-global-conference.html\">Voices Global Conference</a>, presented by <a href=\"http://www.globaltechwomen.com/\">Global Tech Women</a>. As part of this 24-hour live streamed event, Google will provide more than a dozen hours of free talks featuring women working in computer science, beginning today. To access the full schedule and our ongoing broadcasts, see our section on the <a href=\"http://www.globaltechwomen.com/google-channel.html\">Voices website</a>, which will be updated throughout the day.<br />
<br />
The Voices Global Conference is the brainchild of Global Tech Women’s founder Deanna Kosaraju, who also started <a href=\"http://gracehopper.org.in/2012/blog/\">India’s Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing</a> in 2010 with grant support from Google. The India conferences, which provide a forum for women to share their professional and research work in computing, have grown rapidly, with more than 800 attendees in 2012. So when Deanna proposed this global, 24-hour streamed conference, we knew it was a great opportunity to help women and other audiences around the world learn more and get inspired about the contributions women are making to technology and computer science.<br />
<br />
Our sessions will feature a range of material, from new episodes of the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/women-techmakers/\">Women Techmakers</a> series and interviews with women leaders like the head of <a href=\"http://lexity.com/about/about\">Lexity</a> India <a href=\"http://lexity.com/about/team\">Mani Abrol</a>, to discussions focusing on technologies like <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine\">Google Compute Engine</a>. For a sneak peek of the type of content we’ll be providing, check out Pavni’s story below, produced in conjunction with PBS’ <a href=\"http://www.makers.com/\">MAKERS</a> series. I’ve provided advice to many young people in India interested in studying computer science and pursuing their own dreams—so Pavni’s tenacity, coupled with the encouragement and support she received from her father, resonated with me. We’re excited to share her story and others like it alongside technical conversations and discussions on women in technology as part of this conference. <br />

This year we’re expanding that program to work with some of <i>today’s</i> most iconic brands and innovative marketers, in our new project: <a href=\"http://www.artcopycode.com/\">Art, Copy &amp; Code</a>. <br />
<br />
Art, Copy &amp; Code is a series of projects and experiments to show how creativity and technology can work hand in hand. Some of these will include familiar brands like Volkswagen, Burberry and adidas—projects developed in partnership with their creative teams and agencies. Others will be creative experiments with innovative filmmakers, creative directors and technologists to explore how brands can connect with consumers through a whole range of digital tools—including ads, mobile apps and social experiences. Our first partner project is a new social driving experience—<a href=\"http://smileage.vw.com/\">Volkswagen Smileage</a>. <br />
<br />
Building off their <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR_UYx4vSPs\">2012 campaign</a>, “It’s not the miles, it’s how you live them,” Volkswagen Smileage is a mobile app and web service that aims to add a little bit of fun to every drive, from your daily commutes to holiday road trips. The app measures the fun factor of each trip using a metric called “smileage,” based on signals like weather, traffic, location, time and social interactions (e.g.,  a long drive on a sunny Saturday afternoon might accumulate more smileage than a morning commute in the snow). You can use it with any car, not just Volkswagens.<br />
<br />
Powered by the new <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/+/\">Google+ sign-in</a>, you can choose to share Smileage experience with friends and family. For example, during a road trip, photos and videos taken by you and your co-passengers can be automatically added to a live interactive map. The inspiration for the service came from <a href=\"http://www.kpcb.com/insights/2012-internet-trends\">a recent study</a> showing that every day, 144 million Americans on average spend 52 minutes in a car—76 percent of them alone. We wanted to make that time a more shareable experience. Volkswagen Smileage will be available soon in beta—you can <a href=\"http://smileage.vw.com/\">sign up on this webpage</a> for early access.<br />

Relevant earthquake and tsunami warnings for Japan will now appear on Google Search, Google Maps and Google Now when you search online during a time of crisis. If a major earthquake alert is issued in Kanagawa Prefecture, for example, the alert information will appear on your desktop and mobile screens when you search for relevant information on Google Search and Google Maps.<br />

We hope our technology, including Public Alerts, will help people better prepare for future crises and create more far-reaching support for crisis recovery. This is why in Japan, Google has newly partnered with 14 Japanese prefectures and cities, including seven from the Tōhoku region, to make their government data available online and more easily accessible to users, both during a time of crisis and after. The devastating <a href=\"http://blog.google.org/2011/03/assembling-resources-following.html\">Tōhoku Earthquake</a> struck Japan only two years ago, and the region is still slowly recovering from the tragedy.<br />
<br />
We look forward to expanding Google Public Alerts to more countries and working with more warning providers soon. We also encourage potential partners to read our <a href=\"http://support.google.com/publicalerts\">FAQ</a> and to consider putting data in an open format, such as the Common Alerting Protocol. To learn more about Public Alerts, visit our <a href=\"http://www.google.org/crisisresponse/publicalerts\">Public Alerts homepage</a>. <br />

<br />
Google Play has grown rapidly in the last year, bringing you more content in more languages and places around the globe. In addition to offering more than 700,000 apps and games, we’ve <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/nexus-best-of-google-now-in-three-sizes.html\">partnered</a> with all of the major music companies, movie studios and publishers to bring you the music, movies, TV shows, books and magazines you love. And we’ve added more ways for you to buy them, including paying through your phone bill and gift cards, which we're beginning to roll out in the U.K. this week. <br />
<br />
Since no birthday is complete without presents, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_2013_play_birthday\">we’re celebrating</a> with a bunch of special offers across the store on songs, TV shows, movies and books. We’re even offering a collection of games with some fun birthday surprises created by developers. <br />
<br />
It’s been a busy year, but we’re just getting started. We look forward to many more years of bringing you the best in entertainment!<br />

We work exceptionally hard to keep that information safe—hiring some of the best security experts in the world, investing millions of dollars in technology and baking security protections such as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/2step/\">2-step verification</a> into our products.<br />
<br />
Of course, people don’t always use our services for good, and it’s important that law enforcement be able to investigate illegal activity. This may involve requests for personal information. When we receive these requests, we:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>scrutinize them carefully to ensure they satisfy the law and our policies;</li>
<li>seek to narrow requests that are overly broad;</li>
<li>notify users when appropriate so they can contact the entity requesting the information or consult a lawyer; and</li>
<li>require that government agencies use a search warrant if they’re seeking search query information or private content, like Gmail and documents, stored in a Google Account.</li>
</ul><br />
When conducting national security investigations, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation can issue a National Security Letter (NSL) to obtain identifying information about a subscriber from telephone and Internet companies. The FBI has the authority to prohibit companies from talking about these requests. But we’ve been trying to find a way to provide more information about the NSLs we get—particularly as people have voiced concerns about the increase in their use since 9/11.<br />
<br />
Starting today, we’re now including data about NSLs in our Transparency Report. We’re thankful to U.S. government officials for working with us to provide greater insight into the use of NSLs. Visit our page on <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/\">user data requests in the U.S.</a> and you’ll see, in broad strokes, how many NSLs for user data Google receives, as well as the number of accounts in question. In addition, you can now find answers to some common questions we get asked about NSLs on our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/faq/\">Transparency Report FAQ</a>. <br />

You'll notice that we're reporting numerical ranges rather than exact numbers. This is to address concerns raised by the FBI, Justice Department and other agencies that releasing exact numbers might reveal information about investigations. We plan to update these figures annually.<br />

Starting this week, we’re hoping to bring this experience online with “Art Talks,” a series of Hangouts on Air on our Google Art Project <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+googleartproject\">Google+ page</a>. Each month, curators, museum directors, historians and educators from some of the world’s most renowned cultural institutions will reveal the hidden stories behind particular works, examine the curation process and provide insights into particular masterpieces or artists.<br />
<br />
The first guided visit will be held this Wednesday, March 6 at 8pm ET from <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/moma-the-museum-of-modern-art/\">The Museum of Modern Art</a>. Deborah Howes, Director of Digital Learning, along with a panel of artists and students, will discuss how to teach art online. To post a question, visit the <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/110951061820672947345/events/cihbq5nveafs6afav95d9qv33i4\">event page</a>. If this talk falls too late for you to tune in live, you can watch afterward on our Google Art Project <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/googleartproject\">YouTube channel</a>. <br />
<br />
The next talk is from London. On March 20, Caroline Campbell and Arnika Schmidt from the <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/the-national-gallery-london/\">National Gallery</a> will discuss depictions of the female nude. Details are available on the Art Project’s <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cprfu8thes5dmu1h77ih3mvcgu8\">event page</a>. In April we’ll host a panel examining one of the Google Art Project’s popular gigapixel works,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://g.co/artproject/ea6v\">Bruegel’s “Tower of Babel,”</a>&nbsp;featuring Peter Parshall, curator at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/national-gallery-of-art-washington-dc/\">National Gallery of Art</a>&nbsp;in Washington.<br />
<br />

<br />
Additional talks are planned by curators from high-profile institutions such as <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art/\">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.moca.org/\">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> in Los Angeles, the <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/museo-nacional-de-arte/\">Museo Nacional de Arte</a> in Mexico and the <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/the-museum-of-islamic-art-qatar/\">Museum of Islamic Art</a> in Qatar. <br />
<br />
Google Art Project aims to make art more accessible to all. We hope that Art Talks is the next step in bringing art to your armchair, wherever you are in the world, with just a click of a button. Stay tuned to the <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+googleartproject\">Art Project</a> and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+googleculturalinstitute\">Cultural Institute</a> Google+ pages for more information on dates and times of these online lectures.<br />

"html")) "If you’re a blind or low-vision user, you know that working in the cloud poses unique challenges. Our accessibility team had an opportunity to address some of those challenges at the 28th annual <a href=\"http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2013/sessions/index.php\">CSUN International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference</a> this week. While there, we led a workshop on how we’ve been improving the accessibility of Google technologies. For all those who weren’t at the conference, we want to share just a few of those improvements and updates:<br />
<br />
<b>Chrome and Google Apps</b><br />
<ul>
<li>Chrome OS now supports a high-quality text-to-speech voice (starting with U.S. English). We’ve also made spoken feedback, along with screen magnification and high-contrast mode available out-of-the-box to make Chromebook and Chromebox setup easier for users with accessibility needs.</li>
<li>Gmail now has a consistent navigation interface, backed by HTML5 ARIA, which enables blind and low-vision users to effectively navigate using a set of keyboard commands.</li>
<li>It’s now much easier to access content in your Google Drive using a keyboard—for example, you can navigate a list of files with just the arrow keys. In Docs, you can access features using the keyboard, with a new way to search menu and toolbar options. New keyboard shortcuts and verbalization improvements also make it easier to use Docs, Sheets and Slides with a screenreader.</li>
<li>The <a href=\"http://chrome.blogspot.com/2013/02/bringing-voice-recognition-to-web.html\">latest stable version of Chrome</a>, released last week, includes support for the Web Speech API, which developers can use to integrate speech recognition capabilities into their apps. At CSUN, our friends from <a href=\"http://www.bookshare.org/\">Bookshare</a> demonstrated how they use this new functionality to deliver <b>ReadNow</b>—a fully integrated ebook reader for users with print disabilities.</li>
<li>Finally, we released a new <a href=\"http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2994266&amp;topic=29190&amp;ctx=topic\">Help Center Guide</a> specifically for blind and low-vision users to ease the transition to using Google Apps.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Android</b><br />
<ul>
<li>We added Braille support to Android 4.1; since then, Braille support has been expanded on Google Drive for Android, making it easier to read and edit your documents. You can also use Talkback with Docs and Sheets to edit on the go.</li>
<li>With Gesture Mode in Android 4.1, you can reliably navigate the UI using touch and swipe gestures in combination with speech output.</li>
<li>Screen magnification is now built into <a href=\"http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/\">Android 4.2</a>—just enable “Magnification gestures,” then triple tap to enter full screen magnification.</li>
<li>The latest release of <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback\">TalkBack</a> (available on Play soon) includes several highly-requested features like structured browsing of web content and the ability to easily suspend/resume TalkBack via an easy-to-use radial menu.</li>
</ul>
<br />
These updates to Chrome, Google Apps, and Android will help create a better overall experience for our blind and low-vision users, but there’s still room for improvement. Looking ahead, we’re focused on the use of accessibility APIs that will make it easier for third-party developers to create accessible web applications, as well as pushing the state of the art forward with technologies like  speech recognition and text-to-speech. We’re looking forward to working with the rest of the industry to make computers and the web more accessible for everyone. <br />

To get started, you’ll need a computer and a smartphone or tablet that run a modern browser, like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome/\">Chrome</a>. Visit <a href=\"http://www.chrome.com/supersyncsports\">chrome.com/supersyncsports</a> on your computer, pick a game and decide if you’re playing solo or with friends. Next, visit <a href=\"http://g.co/super\">g.co/super</a> in Chrome on your smartphone or tablet and type in the unique code shown on your computer screen. You’ve now “super sync”ed your mobile device with your computer, and you’re ready to race!<br />
<br />
Use the arrow pad on your smartphone or tablet to select one of 50 athletes and prepare yourself for the competition. The motions you make on your mobile touchscreen will move your athlete on your computer screen. To move your athlete forward and win the race, you need to make the correct gestures as quickly as possible. The better you are, the higher your chances of making it to the global leaderboard. <br />

<b>The award for “most-searched” nominee goes to...</b><br />
We took a look at search interest in all of the Oscar nominees across categories. Here's a list of the most searched:<br />

At the end of the show, Best Picture winner “Argo” held the #6 spot, followed by Ang Lee, Christoph Waltz, “Silver Linings Playbook” and Halle Berry.<br />
<br />
<b>The 10 most searched red carpet dresses </b><br />
The red carpet is many people's favorite part of the show. While no Oscar is awarded for \"best dress,\" we wanted to know which gowns caught people's attention this year. The results are in, and the winners are...<br />

<br />
Beyond these top five, Brandi Glanville, Amanda Seyfried, Naomi Watts, Kate Hudson and Zoe Saldana took the next top spots. <br />
<br />
<b>The moments that caught our attention</b><br />
This year's Oscars brought with it a number of unexpected moments that grabbed our attention. Early in the show, Seth MacFarlane was visited by William Shatner in full Captain Kirk regalia, come from the future to save Seth’s monologue; at 8:36pm ET, searches for [kirk] spiked to almost 1,500 per minute. Later in the show, “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Skyfall” tied for sound editing, and people flocked to the web with questions. Searches for [tie] spiked to more than 5,000 per minute, with many people wanting to know [has there ever been a tie in the oscars]. And in a final surprise, First Lady Michelle Obama introduced the Best Picture nominees and opened the winning envelope for “Argo.” Searches for [michelle obama] spiked to 4,500 per minute.<br />
<br />
<b>For more, check out Google Trends and visit our Oscars site</b><br />
Before the ceremony started, we shared our “<a href=\"http://www.google.com/insidesearch/landing/oscars.html#picks\">picks</a>”—who would win if the Oscars were determined by search volume alone. Out of the six Google Search Picks, four actually won! Visit <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a> to explore all the topics you're curious about.

<br />
The students who have been picked for the 10-week program will get the chance to work with organizations focused on exciting projects ranging from those steeped in investigative journalism to those working for press freedom around the world and to those that are helping the industry figure out its future in the digital age.  They will also spend a week with the <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/\">Knight Foundation</a> and a week with Google. <br />
<br />
We had so many applications—on the last day they poured in at a rate of roughly one every two minutes—that we extended our review period by a week to make selections. Our host organizations had the unenviable task of choosing just one Fellow out of the mass of talented students who applied; the Nieman Journalism Lab is taking two Fellows. <br />
<br />
The Fellows who will take part in the program are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><a href=\"http://cironline.org/\">Center for Investigative Reporting</a> - Nathaniel Lash of the <a href=\"http://illinois.edu/\">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a></li>
<li><a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> - Lauren Fedor of <a href=\"http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/\">Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism</a></li>

For many of you, they have become the perfect, additional (and yes, affordable) computer: ideal for catching up on emails, sharing documents and chatting via Hangouts. We’re tremendously grateful to our partners—Samsung, Acer, Lenovo and HP—for their commitment. The momentum has been remarkable: the Samsung Chromebook has been #1 on Amazon’s bestseller list for laptops every day since it launched 125 days ago in the U.S., and Chromebooks now represent <a href=\"http://www.dixonsretail.com/dixons/en/mediacentre/mediapressreleases?id=568\">more than 10 percent</a> of notebook sales at Currys PC World, the largest electronics retailer in the U.K.<br />
<br />
So what’s next? Today we’re excited to announce our newest laptop—<a href=\"http://www.chromebook.com/pixel\">the Chromebook Pixel</a>—which brings together the best in hardware, software and design to inspire the next generation of Chromebooks. With the Pixel, we set out to rethink all elements of a computer in order to design the best laptop possible, especially for power users who have fully embraced the cloud. The philosophy of <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html\">Chrome</a> has always been to minimize the “chrome” of the browser. In much the same way, the goal of the Pixel is to make the pixels disappear, giving people the best web experience.<br />
<br />
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LoTs8zQf-Ms/USZYThtROtI/AAAAAAAAL44/phpHaFDbnd8/s1600/two_arrows_2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LoTs8zQf-Ms/USZYThtROtI/AAAAAAAAL44/phpHaFDbnd8/s400/two_arrows_2.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>
<br />
Let’s start with the screen. This Chromebook has the highest pixel density (239 pixels per inch) of any laptop screen on the market today. Packed with 4.3 million pixels, the display offers sharp text, vivid colors and extra-wide viewing angles. With a screen this rich and engaging, you want to reach out and touch it—so we added touch for a more immersive experience. Touch makes it simple and intuitive to do things like organize tabs, swipe through apps and edit photos with the tip of your finger.<br />
<br />
The Pixel has been engineered with the highest quality components to ensure it’s comfortable to use all day long and meets the needs of demanding power users. The body of the Pixel is made from an anodized aluminum alloy to create a smooth and durable surface; vents are hidden, screws are invisible and the stereo speakers are seamlessly tucked away beneath the backlit keyboard. The touchpad is made from etched glass, analyzed and honed using a laser microscope to ensure precise navigation. The Pixel also has powerful, full-range speakers for crisp sound, a 720p webcam for clear video, and a total of three microphones designed to cancel out surrounding noise.<br />
<br />
Other aspects of the Pixel include:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Speed</b>: Speed has been a core tenet of Chrome and Chromebooks since the beginning. For Pixel, it’s critical that the overall experience, everything from loading webpages to switching between apps, is near instant. Powered by an Intel® Core™ i5 Processor and a solid state Flash memory architecture, the Pixel performs remarkably fast.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><b>Connectivity</b>: The Pixel has an industry-leading WiFi range thanks to carefully positioned antennas and dual-band support. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)\">Long-term evolution (LTE)</a> is engineered directly into the machine, delivering fast connectivity across Verizon's network, the largest, fastest 4G LTE network in the U.S. (LTE model optional). It also comes with 12 free GoGo® Inflight Internet passes for those times you need to connect while in the air.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><b>Storage</b>: Since this Chromebook is for people who live in the cloud, one terabyte of Google Drive cloud storage* is included with the Pixel. This enables you to save, access and share photos, videos, documents, and all of your stuff from all of your devices, from anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Finally, as you’ve come to expect from all Chromebooks, all of your favorite Google products like Search, Gmail, YouTube, Maps and Google+ Hangouts are integrated and just a click away. And since it’s based on Chrome OS, the Pixel boots up in seconds and never slows down, requires <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/features-learnmore.html#devices-feature-nohassles\">almost zero setup or maintenance</a>, and comes with built-in virus protection. Best of all, it stays up to date with automatic updates every few weeks.<br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/j-XTpdDDXiU\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />
<br />
If you want to be part of the next step in the Chromebook journey, the Pixel will be available for purchase starting today on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=chromebook_pixel_wifi\">Google Play</a> in the U.S. and U.K., and soon on BestBuy.com. The WiFi version ($1,299 U.S. and £1,049 U.K.) will start shipping next week and the LTE version ($1,449) will ship in the U.S. in April. If you’re interested in a hands-on experience, you can visit select <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebook-pixel/#stores\">Best Buy (U.S.)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/devices/chromebook-pixel/#stores\">Currys PC World (U.K.)</a> store locations.<br />
<br />
It’s one of the most exciting times in the history of personal computing, thanks to a rapid pace of change, innovation and consumer adoption of devices. Our goal is to continue to push the experience forward for everyone, working with the entire ecosystem to build the next generation of Chrome OS devices. We hope you enjoy what’s next.<br />

Whether it’s romance, horror, or action adventure, there's no better way to step into another world—even if just for a couple of hours. And for the past 85 years, millions of people throughout the world have gathered around their TVs to watch the Oscars and celebrate the people who make these moments possible.<br />

"html")) "Have you ever gotten a plea to wire money to a friend stranded at an international airport? An oddly written message from someone you haven’t heard from in ages? Compared to five years ago, more scams, illegal, fraudulent or spammy messages today come from someone you know. Although spam filters have become very powerful—in Gmail, less than 1 percent of spam emails make it into an inbox—these unwanted messages are much more likely to make it through if they come from someone you’ve been in contact with before. As a result, in 2010 spammers started changing their tactics—and we saw a large increase in fraudulent mail sent from Google Accounts. In turn, our security team has developed new ways to keep you safe, and dramatically reduced the amount of these messages.<br />
<br />
<b>Spammers’ new trick—hijacking accounts </b><br />
To improve their chances of beating a spam filter by sending you spam from your contact’s account, the spammer first has to break into that account. This means many spammers are turning into account thieves. Every day, cyber criminals break into websites to steal databases of usernames and passwords—the online “keys” to accounts. They put the databases up for sale on the black market, or use them for their own nefarious purposes. Because many people re-use the same password across different accounts, stolen passwords from one site are often valid on others. <br />
<br />
With stolen passwords in hand, attackers attempt to break into accounts across the web and across many different services. We’ve seen a single attacker using stolen passwords to attempt to break into a million different Google accounts every single day, for weeks at a time. A different gang attempted sign-ins at a rate of more than 100 accounts per second. Other services are often more vulnerable to this type of attack, but when someone tries to log into your Google Account, our security system does more than just check that a password is correct. <br />
<br />

<b>How Google Security helps protect your account</b><br />
Every time you sign in to Google, whether via your web browser once a month or an email program that checks for new mail every five minutes, our system performs a complex risk analysis to determine how likely it is that the sign-in really comes from you. In fact, there are more than 120 variables that can factor into how a decision is made.<br />
<br />
If a sign-in is deemed suspicious or risky for some reason—maybe it’s coming from a country oceans away from your last sign-in—we ask some simple questions about your account. For example, we may ask for the phone number associated with your account, or for the answer to your security question. These questions are normally hard for a hijacker to solve, but are easy for the real owner. Using security measures like these, we've dramatically reduced the number of compromised accounts by 99.7 percent since the peak of these hijacking attempts in 2011.<br />
<br />

<b>Help protect your account</b><br />
While we do our best to keep spammers at bay, you can help protect your account by making sure you’re using a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/goodtoknow/online-safety/passwords/\">strong, unique password</a> for your Google Account, upgrading your account to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/2step/\">use 2-step verification</a>, and <a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/UpdateAccountRecoveryOptions?hl=en&amp;service=oz\">updating the recovery options</a> on your account such as your secondary email address and your phone number. Following these three steps can help prevent your account from being hijacked—this means less spam for your friends and contacts, and improved security and privacy for you.  <br />

The pieces were chosen by a group of journalists, artists and graffiti experts and include artists such as <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/sao-paulo-street-art/artwork/untitled-speto/34232047/\">Speto</a>, <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/sao-paulo-street-art/artwork/untitled-kobra/34122557/\">Kobra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/sao-paulo-street-art/artwork/sp24-invader/33439090/\">Space Invader</a>, as well as images of São Paulo’s most famous building-size murals.

Photography features strongly in the works our partners are bringing online this time around. The <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/fundacion-mapfre/\">Fundacion MAPFRE</a> in Spain showcases one of the largest collections with more than 300 photos from a number of renowned photographers. For example, you can explore Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide’s black and white <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/fundacion-mapfre/artwork/volantin-san-martin-tilcajete-oaxaca-mexico-graciela-iturbide/29665185/\">images</a> of indigenous Mexican culture inspired by themes of ritual, death and feminism.<br />
<br />
The Art Project is also becoming a home to rare and precious items which move beyond paintings. <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/museum-of-literature-petofi/\">Petőfi Literary Museum</a> in Hungary has contributed the Nemzeti Dal or “<a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/museum-of-literature-petofi/artwork/national-song-sandor-petofi/31773251/\">National Song</a>,” a Hungarian poem which is said to have been the inspiration for the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The original document has rarely been seen in public to prevent humidity and light fading the script further. Online now for the first time, it can be explored by anyone in the world.<br />
<br />
With 40,000+ artworks to explore from more than 200 museums in more than 40 countries, we look forward to seeing these new works feature in hundreds of thousands of user galleries you have created to date. Keep an eye on our <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+GoogleArtProject/posts\">Google+ page</a> for more details about the new collections.<br />

Usually we grab a pad of sticky-notes, scribble a reminder and put it on the desk, the fridge or the relevant page of a magazine. Unfortunately, if you’re like me you probably often discover that the desk, fridge or magazine wasn’t such a clever place to leave the note after all...it’s rarely where you need it when you need it.<br />
<br />
To solve this problem we’ve created Google Keep. With Keep you can quickly jot ideas down when you think of them and even include checklists and photos to keep track of what’s important to you. Your notes are safely stored in Google Drive and synced to all your devices so you can always have them at hand.<br />
<br />
If it’s more convenient to speak than to type that’s fine—Keep transcribes voice memos for you automatically. There’s super-fast search to find what you’re looking for and when you’re finished with a note you can archive or delete it.<br />

Changing priorities isn’t a problem: just open Keep on your Android phone or tablet (there’s a widget so you can have Keep front and center all the time) and drag your notes around to reflect what matters. You can choose the color for each note too.<br />
<br />
Pro tip: for adding thoughts quickly without unlocking your device there's a lock screen widget (on devices running Android 4.2+).<br />

If you’re like me, the list is pretty long—to be honest I’d be lucky to get to all of mine. Google Maps has a bucket list too, and today we’re checking off a couple of our favorites so we can make our map more comprehensive and share it with you. And if tall mountains are your thing, you’re in luck. <br />
<br />
Now you can explore some of the most famous mountains on Earth, including Aconcagua (South America), Kilimanjaro (Africa), Mount Elbrus (Europe) and Everest Base Camp (Asia) on Google Maps. These mountains belong to the group of peaks known as the Seven Summits—the highest mountain on each of the seven continents. While there’s nothing quite like standing on the mountain, with Google Maps you can instantly transport yourself to the top of these peaks and enjoy the sights without all of the avalanches, rock slides, crevasses, and dangers from altitude and weather that mountaineers face. <br />
<br />
Start your adventure on Tanzania’s Mount Kilimanjaro, the dormant volcano known as the Roof of Africa. See amazing views of the highest freestanding mountain in the world covered in snow just three degrees south of the equator.<br />

If you’re like me, the list is pretty long—to be honest I’d be lucky to get to all of mine. Google Maps has a bucket list too, and today we’re checking off a couple of our favorites so we can make our map more comprehensive and share it with you. And if tall mountains are your thing, you’re in luck. <br />
<br />
Now you can explore some of the most famous mountains on Earth, including Aconcagua (South America), Kilimanjaro (Africa), Mount Elbrus (Europe) and Everest Base Camp (Asia) on Google Maps. These mountains belong to the group of peaks known as the Seven Summits—the highest mountain on each of the seven continents. While there’s nothing quite like standing on the mountain, with Google Maps you can instantly transport yourself to the top of these peaks and enjoy the sights without all of the avalanches, rock slides, crevasses, and dangers from altitude and weather that mountaineers face. <br />
<br />
Start your adventure on Tanzania’s Mount Kilimanjaro, the dormant volcano known as the Roof of Africa. See amazing views of the highest freestanding mountain in the world covered in snow just three degrees south of the equator.<br />

To make the most of these opportunities, we need to focus—otherwise we spread ourselves too thin and lack impact.  So today we’re announcing some more closures, bringing the total to 70 features or services closed since our <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/fall-spring-clean.html\">spring cleaning began</a> in 2011:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Apps Script </b>will be deprecating the <b>GUI Builder</b> and <b>five UiApp widgets</b> in order to focus efforts on <a href=\"http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2012/06/big-updates-for-apps-script.html\">Html Service</a>. The rest of the Ui Service will not be affected. The GUI Builder will continue to be available until September 16, 2013. For more information see <a href=\"http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/03/retiring-a-few-apps-script-components.html\">our post</a> on the Google Apps Developer Blog.</li>
<li><b><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/caldav\">CalDAV API</a> </b>will become available for whitelisted developers, and will be shut down for other developers on September 16, 2013. Most developers’ use cases are handled well by <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/\">Google Calendar API</a>, which we recommend using instead. If you’re a developer and the Calendar API won’t work for you, please fill out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/19gOLSlkTzHi-zub3BkMv7Ot0JMLPj4YSxJUBseGAMSg/viewform\">this form</a> to tell us about your use case and request access to whitelisted-only CalDAV API.</li>
<li><b>Google Building Maker</b> helped people to make three-dimensional building models for Google Earth and Maps. It will be retired on June 1, but users are still able to access and export their models from the 3D Warehouse. We’ll continue to expand the availability of comprehensive and accurate <a href=\"http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/06/take-flight-through-new-3d-cities-on.html\">new 3D imagery on Google Earth</a>, and people can still use <a href=\"http://support.google.com/mapmaker/answer/2802405?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2802453\">Google Map Maker</a> to add building information such as outlines and heights to Google Maps.</li>
<li><b>Google Cloud Connect </b>is a plug-in to help people work in the cloud by automatically saving Microsoft Office files from Windows PCs in Google Drive. But <a href=\"http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?answer=3017040\">installing Google Drive</a> on your <a href=\"http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2375078\">desktop</a> achieves the same thing more effectively—and Drive works not only on Windows, but also on Mac, Android and iOS devices. Existing users will no longer be able to use Cloud Connect as of April 30.</li>
<li>We launched <b>Google Reader</b> in 2005 in an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites. While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader. Users and developers interested in RSS alternatives can export their data, including their subscriptions, with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1#custom:reader\">Google Takeout</a> over the course of the next four months.</li>
<li>Beginning next week, we're ending support for the <b>Google Voice App for Blackberry</b>. For Blackberry users who want to continue using Google Voice, we recommend they use our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/m?uipref=1\">HTML5 app</a>, which is more secure and easier for us to keep up to date.  Our HTML5 site is compatible with users with Blackberry version 6 and newer.</li>
<li>We’re deprecating our <b><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-search/\">Search API for Shopping</a></b>, which has enabled developers to create shopping apps based on Google’s Product Search data. While we believe in the value this offering provided, we’re shifting our focus to concentrate on creating a <a href=\"http://adwords.blogspot.com/2012/05/building-better-shopping-experience.html\">better shopping experience</a> for users through Google Shopping. We’ll shut the API down completely on September 16, 2013.</li>
<li>Beginning today we’ll no longer sell or provide updates for <b>Snapseed Desktop for Macintosh and Windows</b>. Existing customers will continue to be able to download the software and can <a href=\"http://www.niksoftware.com/support/usa/entry.php\">contact us</a> for support. We’ll continue to offer the Snapseed mobile app on iOS and Android for free.</li>
</ul>
<br />
These changes are never easy.  But by focusing our efforts, we can concentrate on building great products that really help in their lives.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Update</b> March 15, 2013</i>: We worked with the developers who provide 98 percent of our current CalDAV traffic to assure access to the CalDAV API, which means many popular products will not be impacted. We remain committed to supporting open protocols like CalDAV.  <br />

He believed that aligning standards around an open-source operating system would drive innovation across the mobile industry. Most people thought he was nuts. But his insight immediately struck a chord because at the time it was extremely painful developing services for mobile devices. We had a closet full of more than 100 phones and were building our software pretty much device by device. It was nearly impossible for us to make truly great mobile experiences.        <br />
<br />
Fast forward to today. The pace of innovation has never been greater, and Android is the most used mobile operating system in the world: we have a global partnership of over 60 manufacturers; more than 750 million devices have been activated globally; and 25 billion apps have now been downloaded from Google Play. Pretty extraordinary progress for a decade’s work. Having exceeded even the crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for Android—and with a really strong leadership team in place—Andy’s decided it’s time to hand over the reins and start a new chapter at Google. Andy, more moonshots please!<br />
<br />
Going forward, Sundar Pichai will lead Android, in addition to his existing work with Chrome and Apps.  Sundar has a talent for creating products that are technically excellent yet easy to use—and he loves a big bet. Take Chrome, for example. In 2008, people asked whether the world really needed another browser.  Today Chrome has hundreds of millions of happy users and is growing fast thanks to its speed, simplicity and security. So while Andy’s a really hard act to follow, I know Sundar will do a tremendous job doubling down on Android as we work to push the ecosystem forward.  <br />
<br />
Today we’re living in a new computing environment. People are really excited about technology and spending a lot of money on devices. This is driving faster adoption than we have ever seen before. The Nexus program—developed in conjunction with our partners Asus, HTC, LG and Samsung—has become a beacon of innovation for the industry, and services such as Google Now have the potential to really improve your life. We’re getting closer to a world where technology takes care of the hard work—discovery, organization, communication—so that you can get on with what makes you happiest… living and loving. It’s an exciting time to be at Google.  <br />

He believed that aligning standards around an open-source operating system would drive innovation across the mobile industry. Most people thought he was nuts. But his insight immediately struck a chord because at the time it was extremely painful developing services for mobile devices. We had a closet full of more than 100 phones and were building our software pretty much device by device. It was nearly impossible for us to make truly great mobile experiences.        <br />
<br />
Fast forward to today. The pace of innovation has never been greater, and Android is the most used mobile operating system in the world: we have a global partnership of over 60 manufacturers; more than 750 million devices have been activated globally; and 25 billion apps have now been downloaded from Google Play. Pretty extraordinary progress for a decade’s work. Having exceeded even the crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for Android—and with a really strong leadership team in place—Andy’s decided it’s time to hand over the reins and start a new chapter at Google. Andy, more moonshots please!<br />
<br />
Going forward, Sundar Pichai will lead Android, in addition to his existing work with Chrome and Apps.  Sundar has a talent for creating products that are technically excellent yet easy to use—and he loves a big bet. Take Chrome, for example. In 2008, people asked whether the world really needed another browser.  Today Chrome has hundreds of millions of happy users and is growing fast thanks to its speed, simplicity and security. So while Andy’s a really hard act to follow, I know Sundar will do a tremendous job doubling down on Android as we work to push the ecosystem forward.  <br />

The app measures the fun factor of each trip using a metric called “smileage,” based on signals like weather, traffic, location, time and social interactions (e.g.,  a long drive on a sunny Saturday afternoon might accumulate more smileage than a morning commute in the snow). You can use it with any car, not just Volkswagens.<br />

Powered by the new <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/+/\">Google+ sign-in</a>, you can choose to share Smileage experience with friends and family. For example, during a road trip, photos and videos taken by you and your co-passengers can be automatically added to a live interactive map. The inspiration for the service came from <a href=\"http://www.kpcb.com/insights/2012-internet-trends\">a recent study</a> showing that every day, 144 million Americans on average spend 52 minutes in a car—76 percent of them alone. We wanted to make that time a more shareable experience.

The inspiration for the service came from <a href=\"http://www.kpcb.com/insights/2012-internet-trends\">a recent study</a> showing that every day, 144 million Americans on average spend 52 minutes in a car—76 percent of them alone. We wanted to make that time a more shareable experience. Volkswagen Smileage will be available soon in beta—you can <a href=\"http://smileage.vw.com/\">sign up on this webpage</a> for early access.<br />

Relevant earthquake and tsunami warnings for Japan will now appear on Google Search, Google Maps and Google Now when you search online during a time of crisis. If a major earthquake alert is issued in Kanagawa Prefecture, for example, the alert information will appear on your desktop and mobile screens when you search for relevant information on Google Search and Google Maps.<br />

We’re able to provide Public Alerts in Japan thanks to the Japan Meteorological Agency, whose publication of data enables Google and others to make critical and life-saving information more widely available. <br />
<br />
We hope our technology, including Public Alerts, will help people better prepare for future crises and create more far-reaching support for crisis recovery. This is why in Japan, Google has newly partnered with 14 Japanese prefectures and cities, including seven from the Tōhoku region, to make their government data available online and more easily accessible to users, both during a time of crisis and after. The devastating <a href=\"http://blog.google.org/2011/03/assembling-resources-following.html\">Tōhoku Earthquake</a> struck Japan only two years ago, and the region is still slowly recovering from the tragedy.<br />
<br />
We look forward to expanding Google Public Alerts to more countries and working with more warning providers soon. We also encourage potential partners to read our <a href=\"http://support.google.com/publicalerts\">FAQ</a> and to consider putting data in an open format, such as the Common Alerting Protocol.

Of course, people don’t always use our services for good, and it’s important that law enforcement be able to investigate illegal activity. This may involve requests for personal information. When we receive these requests, we:<br />

<ul><li>scrutinize them carefully to ensure they satisfy the law and our policies;</li>
<li>seek to narrow requests that are overly broad;</li>
<li>notify users when appropriate so they can contact the entity requesting the information or consult a lawyer; and</li>
<li>require that government agencies use a search warrant if they’re seeking search query information or private content, like Gmail and documents, stored in a Google Account.</li>

When conducting national security investigations, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation can issue a National Security Letter (NSL) to obtain identifying information about a subscriber from telephone and Internet companies. The FBI has the authority to prohibit companies from talking about these requests. But we’ve been trying to find a way to provide more information about the NSLs we get—particularly as people have voiced concerns about the increase in their use since 9/11.<br />
<br />
Starting today, we’re now including data about NSLs in our Transparency Report. We’re thankful to U.S. government officials for working with us to provide greater insight into the use of NSLs. Visit our page on <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/\">user data requests in the U.S.</a> and you’ll see, in broad strokes, how many NSLs for user data Google receives, as well as the number of accounts in question. In addition, you can now find answers to some common questions we get asked about NSLs on our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/faq/\">Transparency Report FAQ</a>. <br />

Our accessibility team had an opportunity to address some of those challenges at the 28th annual <a href=\"http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2013/sessions/index.php\">CSUN International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference</a> this week. While there, we led a workshop on how we’ve been improving the accessibility of Google technologies. For all those who weren’t at the conference, we want to share just a few of those improvements and updates:<br />
<br />
<b>Chrome and Google Apps</b><br />
<ul>
<li>Chrome OS now supports a high-quality text-to-speech voice (starting with U.S. English). We’ve also made spoken feedback, along with screen magnification and high-contrast mode available out-of-the-box to make Chromebook and Chromebox setup easier for users with accessibility needs.</li>
<li>Gmail now has a consistent navigation interface, backed by HTML5 ARIA, which enables blind and low-vision users to effectively navigate using a set of keyboard commands.</li>
<li>It’s now much easier to access content in your Google Drive using a keyboard—for example, you can navigate a list of files with just the arrow keys. In Docs, you can access features using the keyboard, with a new way to search menu and toolbar options. New keyboard shortcuts and verbalization improvements also make it easier to use Docs, Sheets and Slides with a screenreader.</li>
<li>The <a href=\"http://chrome.blogspot.com/2013/02/bringing-voice-recognition-to-web.html\">latest stable version of Chrome</a>, released last week, includes support for the Web Speech API, which developers can use to integrate speech recognition capabilities into their apps. At CSUN, our friends from <a href=\"http://www.bookshare.org/\">Bookshare</a> demonstrated how they use this new functionality to deliver <b>ReadNow</b>—a fully integrated ebook reader for users with print disabilities.</li>
<li>Finally, we released a new <a href=\"http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2994266&amp;topic=29190&amp;ctx=topic\">Help Center Guide</a> specifically for blind and low-vision users to ease the transition to using Google Apps.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Android</b><br />
<ul>
<li>We added Braille support to Android 4.1; since then, Braille support has been expanded on Google Drive for Android, making it easier to read and edit your documents. You can also use Talkback with Docs and Sheets to edit on the go.</li>
<li>With Gesture Mode in Android 4.1, you can reliably navigate the UI using touch and swipe gestures in combination with speech output.</li>
<li>Screen magnification is now built into <a href=\"http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/\">Android 4.2</a>—just enable “Magnification gestures,” then triple tap to enter full screen magnification.</li>
<li>The latest release of <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback\">TalkBack</a> (available on Play soon) includes several highly-requested features like structured browsing of web content and the ability to easily suspend/resume TalkBack via an easy-to-use radial menu.</li>
</ul>
<br />
These updates to Chrome, Google Apps, and Android will help create a better overall experience for our blind and low-vision users, but there’s still room for improvement. Looking ahead, we’re focused on the use of accessibility APIs that will make it easier for third-party developers to create accessible web applications, as well as pushing the state of the art forward with technologies like  speech recognition and text-to-speech. We’re looking forward to working with the rest of the industry to make computers and the web more accessible for everyone. <br />

We believe in a free and open Internet where everyone can express their opinions and learn from others. For this reason, for the past several years we’ve partnered with Reporters Without Borders to organize their annual Netizen of the Year Award, which honors an Internet user, blogger or cyber-dissident who has made a notable contribution in defense of online freedom of expression. <br />
<br />
This year for the first time, Reporters Without Borders is asking <i>you</i> to help decide who will win the award. Nine “netizens”—from Bulgaria, Egypt, Honduras, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mali, Russia, Senegal and Vietnam—have been nominated for consideration. Watch the videos showing their stories and then vote at <a href=\"http://youtube.com/netizen2013\">youtube.com/netizen2013</a>.<br />

This year's Oscars brought with it a number of unexpected moments that grabbed our attention. Early in the show, Seth MacFarlane was visited by William Shatner in full Captain Kirk regalia, come from the future to save Seth’s monologue; at 8:36pm ET, searches for [kirk] spiked to almost 1,500 per minute. Later in the show, “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Skyfall” tied for sound editing, and people flocked to the web with questions. Searches for [tie] spiked to more than 5,000 per minute, with many people wanting to know [has there ever been a tie in the oscars]. And in a final surprise, First Lady Michelle Obama introduced the Best Picture nominees and opened the winning envelope for “Argo.” Searches for [michelle obama] spiked to 4,500 per minute.<br />

For many of you, they have become the perfect, additional (and yes, affordable) computer: ideal for catching up on emails, sharing documents and chatting via Hangouts. We’re tremendously grateful to our partners—Samsung, Acer, Lenovo and HP—for their commitment. The momentum has been remarkable: the Samsung Chromebook has been #1 on Amazon’s bestseller list for laptops every day since it launched 125 days ago in the U.S., and Chromebooks now represent <a href=\"http://www.dixonsretail.com/dixons/en/mediacentre/mediapressreleases?id=568\">more than 10 percent</a> of notebook sales at Currys PC World, the largest electronics retailer in the U.K.<br />

So what’s next? Today we’re excited to announce our newest laptop—<a href=\"http://www.chromebook.com/pixel\">the Chromebook Pixel</a>—which brings together the best in hardware, software and design to inspire the next generation of Chromebooks. With the Pixel, we set out to rethink all elements of a computer in order to design the best laptop possible, especially for power users who have fully embraced the cloud. The philosophy of <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html\">Chrome</a> has always been to minimize the “chrome” of the browser.

<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LoTs8zQf-Ms/USZYThtROtI/AAAAAAAAL44/phpHaFDbnd8/s1600/two_arrows_2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LoTs8zQf-Ms/USZYThtROtI/AAAAAAAAL44/phpHaFDbnd8/s400/two_arrows_2.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>
<br />
Let’s start with the screen. This Chromebook has the highest pixel density (239 pixels per inch) of any laptop screen on the market today. Packed with 4.3 million pixels, the display offers sharp text, vivid colors and extra-wide viewing angles. With a screen this rich and engaging, you want to reach out and touch it—so we added touch for a more immersive experience. Touch makes it simple and intuitive to do things like organize tabs, swipe through apps and edit photos with the tip of your finger.<br />
<br />
The Pixel has been engineered with the highest quality components to ensure it’s comfortable to use all day long and meets the needs of demanding power users. The body of the Pixel is made from an anodized aluminum alloy to create a smooth and durable surface; vents are hidden, screws are invisible and the stereo speakers are seamlessly tucked away beneath the backlit keyboard. The touchpad is made from etched glass, analyzed and honed using a laser microscope to ensure precise navigation. The Pixel also has powerful, full-range speakers for crisp sound, a 720p webcam for clear video, and a total of three microphones designed to cancel out surrounding noise.<br />
<br />
Other aspects of the Pixel include:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Speed</b>: Speed has been a core tenet of Chrome and Chromebooks since the beginning. For Pixel, it’s critical that the overall experience, everything from loading webpages to switching between apps, is near instant. Powered by an Intel® Core™ i5 Processor and a solid state Flash memory architecture, the Pixel performs remarkably fast.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><b>Connectivity</b>: The Pixel has an industry-leading WiFi range thanks to carefully positioned antennas and dual-band support. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)\">Long-term evolution (LTE)</a> is engineered directly into the machine, delivering fast connectivity across Verizon's network, the largest, fastest 4G LTE network in the U.S. (LTE model optional). It also comes with 12 free GoGo® Inflight Internet passes for those times you need to connect while in the air.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><b>Storage</b>: Since this Chromebook is for people who live in the cloud, one terabyte of Google Drive cloud storage* is included with the Pixel. This enables you to save, access and share photos, videos, documents, and all of your stuff from all of your devices, from anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Finally, as you’ve come to expect from all Chromebooks, all of your favorite Google products like Search, Gmail, YouTube, Maps and Google+ Hangouts are integrated and just a click away. And since it’s based on Chrome OS, the Pixel boots up in seconds and never slows down, requires <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/features-learnmore.html#devices-feature-nohassles\">almost zero setup or maintenance</a>, and comes with built-in virus protection. Best of all, it stays up to date with automatic updates every few weeks.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you want to be part of the next step in the Chromebook journey, the Pixel will be available for purchase starting today on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=chromebook_pixel_wifi\">Google Play</a> in the U.S. and U.K., and soon on BestBuy.com. The WiFi version ($1,299 U.S. and £1,049 U.K.) will start shipping next week and the LTE version ($1,449) will ship in the U.S. in April. If you’re interested in a hands-on experience, you can visit select <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebook-pixel/#stores\">Best Buy (U.S.)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/devices/chromebook-pixel/#stores\">Currys PC World (U.K.)</a> store locations.<br />
<br />
It’s one of the most exciting times in the history of personal computing, thanks to a rapid pace of change, innovation and consumer adoption of devices. Our goal is to continue to push the experience forward for everyone, working with the entire ecosystem to build the next generation of Chrome OS devices. We hope you enjoy what’s next.<br />

<br />
Whether your state tops the submissions race or not, you still have the chance to become the individual state winner. The 50 state winners will win an all-expenses paid trip to New York City in May for the final awards ceremony, where we’ll reveal the winning doodle. The national winner will see his or her doodle on the Google homepage, win a $30,000 college scholarship and a $50,000 technology grant for his or her school. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodle4google/entry.html\">Download an entry form</a> today to get doodling! <br />
<br />
Fun fact for those of you who can’t get enough doodles: we run Doodle 4 Google competitions in many countries worldwide, year-round. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/ALL_ie/doodle4google/vote.html\">Vote for your Irish favorites now</a>—the winner will appear on <a href=\"http://www.google.ie/\">www.google.ie</a> on April 16.<br />
<br />
As always, happy doodling! <br />

An oddly written message from someone you haven’t heard from in ages? Compared to five years ago, more scams, illegal, fraudulent or spammy messages today come from someone you know. Although spam filters have become very powerful—in Gmail, less than 1 percent of spam emails make it into an inbox—these unwanted messages are much more likely to make it through if they come from someone you’ve been in contact with before. As a result, in 2010 spammers started changing their tactics—and we saw a large increase in fraudulent mail sent from Google Accounts. In turn, our security team has developed new ways to keep you safe, and dramatically reduced the amount of these messages.<br />
<br />
<b>Spammers’ new trick—hijacking accounts </b><br />
To improve their chances of beating a spam filter by sending you spam from your contact’s account, the spammer first has to break into that account. This means many spammers are turning into account thieves. Every day, cyber criminals break into websites to steal databases of usernames and passwords—the online “keys” to accounts. They put the databases up for sale on the black market, or use them for their own nefarious purposes. Because many people re-use the same password across different accounts, stolen passwords from one site are often valid on others. <br />
<br />
With stolen passwords in hand, attackers attempt to break into accounts across the web and across many different services. We’ve seen a single attacker using stolen passwords to attempt to break into a million different Google accounts every single day, for weeks at a time. A different gang attempted sign-ins at a rate of more than 100 accounts per second. Other services are often more vulnerable to this type of attack, but when someone tries to log into your Google Account, our security system does more than just check that a password is correct. <br />
<br />

<b>How Google Security helps protect your account</b><br />
Every time you sign in to Google, whether via your web browser once a month or an email program that checks for new mail every five minutes, our system performs a complex risk analysis to determine how likely it is that the sign-in really comes from you. In fact, there are more than 120 variables that can factor into how a decision is made.<br />
<br />
If a sign-in is deemed suspicious or risky for some reason—maybe it’s coming from a country oceans away from your last sign-in—we ask some simple questions about your account. For example, we may ask for the phone number associated with your account, or for the answer to your security question. These questions are normally hard for a hijacker to solve, but are easy for the real owner. Using security measures like these, we've dramatically reduced the number of compromised accounts by 99.7 percent since the peak of these hijacking attempts in 2011.<br />
<br />
<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VXOhuVz09uU/USOmVEzeNHI/AAAAAAAAK3w/JMs2nCDyvRY/s1600/Untitled-3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VXOhuVz09uU/USOmVEzeNHI/AAAAAAAAK3w/JMs2nCDyvRY/s500/Untitled-3.png\" width=\"500\" /></a></div><br />
<b>Help protect your account</b><br />
While we do our best to keep spammers at bay, you can help protect your account by making sure you’re using a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/goodtoknow/online-safety/passwords/\">strong, unique password</a> for your Google Account, upgrading your account to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/2step/\">use 2-step verification</a>, and <a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/UpdateAccountRecoveryOptions?hl=en&amp;service=oz\">updating the recovery options</a> on your account such as your secondary email address and your phone number. Following these three steps can help prevent your account from being hijacked—this means less spam for your friends and contacts, and improved security and privacy for you.  <br />

Compared to five years ago, more scams, illegal, fraudulent or spammy messages today come from someone you know. Although spam filters have become very powerful—in Gmail, less than 1 percent of spam emails make it into an inbox—these unwanted messages are much more likely to make it through if they come from someone you’ve been in contact with before. As a result, in 2010 spammers started changing their tactics—and we saw a large increase in fraudulent mail sent from Google Accounts. In turn, our security team has developed new ways to keep you safe, and dramatically reduced the amount of these messages.<br />
<br />
<b>Spammers’ new trick—hijacking accounts </b><br />
To improve their chances of beating a spam filter by sending you spam from your contact’s account, the spammer first has to break into that account. This means many spammers are turning into account thieves. Every day, cyber criminals break into websites to steal databases of usernames and passwords—the online “keys” to accounts. They put the databases up for sale on the black market, or use them for their own nefarious purposes. Because many people re-use the same password across different accounts, stolen passwords from one site are often valid on others. <br />
<br />
With stolen passwords in hand, attackers attempt to break into accounts across the web and across many different services. We’ve seen a single attacker using stolen passwords to attempt to break into a million different Google accounts every single day, for weeks at a time. A different gang attempted sign-ins at a rate of more than 100 accounts per second. Other services are often more vulnerable to this type of attack, but when someone tries to log into your Google Account, our security system does more than just check that a password is correct. <br />

<b>How Google Security helps protect your account</b><br />
Every time you sign in to Google, whether via your web browser once a month or an email program that checks for new mail every five minutes, our system performs a complex risk analysis to determine how likely it is that the sign-in really comes from you. In fact, there are more than 120 variables that can factor into how a decision is made.<br />
<br />
If a sign-in is deemed suspicious or risky for some reason—maybe it’s coming from a country oceans away from your last sign-in—we ask some simple questions about your account. For example, we may ask for the phone number associated with your account, or for the answer to your security question. These questions are normally hard for a hijacker to solve, but are easy for the real owner. Using security measures like these, we've dramatically reduced the number of compromised accounts by 99.7 percent since the peak of these hijacking attempts in 2011.<br />

<b>Help protect your account</b><br />
While we do our best to keep spammers at bay, you can help protect your account by making sure you’re using a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/goodtoknow/online-safety/passwords/\">strong, unique password</a> for your Google Account, upgrading your account to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/2step/\">use 2-step verification</a>, and <a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/UpdateAccountRecoveryOptions?hl=en&amp;service=oz\">updating the recovery options</a> on your account such as your secondary email address and your phone number. Following these three steps can help prevent your account from being hijacked—this means less spam for your friends and contacts, and improved security and privacy for you.  <br />
