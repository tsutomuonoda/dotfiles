For February, my wife and I are trying a gluten-free, wheat-free month to see what that&#8217;s like.</p><p>Okay, so how was January? I started with a week completely off the internet, which coincided with a reading vacation. The fact is that I *love* to read. I averaged about a book a day for a week.</p><p>In general, when I wanted to hop onto Techmeme or Google News or Hacker News or Twitter/Nuzzel, instead I opened up my to-do list. As a result, I got a ton of stuff done in January. I quickly learned that <strong>if something important was happening, I&#8217;d hear about it from someone else</strong>.</p><p>The month off also gave me a chance to think about email dysfunction. I try hard to filter my inbox aggressively: I auto-archive almost all mailing lists, I don&#8217;t sign up for newsletters, and I filter out notifications from web services. Despite that, here&#8217;s what my inbox looked like when I got back:</p><p>- 258 email threads in my inbox (I had 20 when I left). It was a quiet week: the first week in January.<br />
- 153 threads were non-Google email threads<br />
- only 14 threads directly involved members of my team<br />
- 8 threads that involved my manager or someone up my reporting chain<br />
- 6 threads involving PR or legal in some way</p><p>As you can see, <strong>a huge issue for me is email threads that originate from outside Google&#8211;that&#8217;s over half the email threads in my inbox</strong>! I&#8217;m going to keep ramping down on responding to external emails, because replying to a private communication might help that person, but in the same amount of time I could make a webmaster video or write something more general that would help a lot more people. In lots of ways, email just isn&#8217;t scalable.</p><p>Added: Someone asked how I stay in touch enough to know what topics people care about if I&#8217;m not answering email. Sorry if I didn&#8217;t explain that clearly. I still see what people are discussing on SEO blogs and on the Google webmaster forum. I know the most recent trends in how blackhats try to spam Google&#8211;that&#8217;s my primary job, after all. I look through the questions and comments that people send me on Twitter. When I put out a call for webmaster video questions, I use Google Moderator so people can vote up questions that interest them. I keep an eye on what flavors of spam snake oil are being marketing to newbies on various forums (&#8220;I know Google pulled apart my last link network, but now try my Social Rank Tout Suite product! It will automate 100% of all of your link building!&#8221;). And lots of people at Google keep an eye open themselves and alert me if they see issues. So I feel like I have a pretty good feel for the pulse of what people are talking about; it&#8217;s just that I lack the time to have one-on-one conversations with every person that emails me.</p><p>Going away for a week is also a great way to spot emails you should have filtered but didn&#8217;t. For example, I had 8 automatic emails alerting me to various people taking vacation. People work hard at Google; I usually don&#8217;t need to know if you&#8217;re taking a day or two off. I found 4 other mailing lists I could auto-archive or unsubscribe to. In general, <strong>taking some time off provides a useful perspective on what&#8217;s waiting for you when you get back</strong>.</p><p>Is anyone else doing a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html\">30 day challenge?</a> What are you tackling?</p><div class=\"plusone\"><g:plusone href=\"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-time-away-from-the-internet-and-email/\"></g:plusone></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/mattcutts/uJBW/~4/0R1D8etDsPo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-time-away-from-the-internet-and-email/feed/") (slash:comments nil "36") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-time-away-from-the-internet-and-email/")) (item nil (title nil "Taking a week off from the internet") (link nil "http://feeds.mattcutts.com/~r/mattcutts/uJBW/~3/HoF1wOC9vow/") (comments nil "http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/taking-a-week-off-from-the-internet/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sun, 30 Dec 2012 08:41:28 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Matt Cutts") (category nil "30 days") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Their PageRank had dropped from 7 to 3, and they wanted to know why. They genuinely didn&#8217;t seem know what the issue was, so I took some time to write them an in-depth reply.

Hi, the usual reason why a site&#8217;s PageRank drops by 30-50% like this is because the site violates our quality guidelines by selling links that pass PageRank. Here&#8217;s our documentation on that: <a href=\"http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=66356\">http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=66356</a> and here&#8217;s a video I made about this common case: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFcJ7PaLoMw#t=1m29s\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFcJ7PaLoMw</a> (it&#8217;s about 1:30 into the video). <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/business/book-reviewers-for-hire-meet-a-demand-for-online-raves.html?_r=1&#038;pagewanted=all\">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/business/book-reviewers-for-hire-meet-a-demand-for-online-raves.html?_r=1&#038;pagewanted=all</a> is a good recent article about paid reviews. In Google&#8217;s world, we take paid links that pass PageRank as seriously as Amazon would take paid reviews without disclosure or as your newspaper would treat a reporter who was paid to link to a website in an article without disclosing the payment.</p><p>In particular, earlier this year on [website] we saw links labeled as sponsored that passed PageRank, such as a link like [example link]. That&#8217;s a clear violation of Google&#8217;s quality guidelines, and it&#8217;s the reason that [website]&#8216;s PageRank as well as our trust in the website has declined.</p><p>In fact, we received a outside spam report about your site. The spam report passed on an email from a link seller offering to sell links on multiple pages on [website] based on their PageRank. Some pages mentioned in that email continue to have unusual links to this day. For example [example url] has a section labeled &#8220;PARTNER LINKS&#8221; which links to [linkbuyer].</p><p>So my advice would be to investigate how paid links that pass PageRank ended up on [website]: who put them there, are any still up, and to investigate whether someone at the [newspaper] received money to post paid links that pass PageRank without disclosing that payment, e.g. using ambiguous labeling such as &#8220;Partner links.&#8221; That&#8217;s definitely where I would dig.</p><p>After that investigation is complete and any paid links that pass PageRank are removed, the site&#8217;s webmaster can do a reconsideration request using Google&#8217;s free webmaster tools console at <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webmasters/\">google.com/webmasters</a>. I would include as much detail as you can about what you found out about the paid links. That will help us assess how things look going forward.</p><p>Sincerely,<br />
Matt

Here&#8217;s a simple video about how it works:</p><p><center><br /><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/zMabEyrtPRg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /></center></p><p>I often hear the same questions or objections when I recommend two-factor authentication. Jeff Atwood has done a good job of debunking common misperceptions&#8211;<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/04/make-your-email-hacker-proof.html\">check out his post, which even has pictures</a>. But here are some misconceptions that I hear, along with the reality:</p><p><strong>Myth #1</strong>: But what if my cell phone doesn&#8217;t have SMS/signal, or I&#8217;m in a foreign country?<br /><strong>Reality</strong>: You can install a standalone app called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&#038;hl=en\">Google Authenticator</a> (it&#8217;s also <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8\">available in the App Store</a>), so your cell phone doesn&#8217;t need a signal.</p><p><strong>Myth #2</strong>: Okay, but what about if my cell phone runs out of power, or my phone is stolen?<br /><strong>Reality</strong>: You can print out a small piece of paper with 10 one-time rescue codes and put that in your wallet. Use those one-time codes to log in even without your phone.</p><p><strong>Myth #3</strong>: Don&#8217;t I have to fiddle with an extra PIN every time I log in?<br /><strong>Reality</strong>: You can tell Google to trust your computer for 30 days and <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/A9Wu5.png\">sometimes even longer</a>.</p><p><strong>Myth #4</strong>: I heard two-factor authentication doesn&#8217;t work with POP and IMAP?<br /><strong>Reality</strong>: You can still use two-factor authentication even with POP and IMAP. You create a special &#8220;<a href=\"http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=185833\">application-specific password</a>&#8221; that your mail client can use instead of your regular password. You can revoke application-specific passwords at any time.</p><p><strong>Myth #5</strong>: Okay, but what if I want to verify how secure Google Authenticator is?<br /><strong>Reality</strong>: Google Authenticator is free, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/\">open-source</a>, and based on <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238\">open</a><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226\">standards</a>.</p><p><strong>Myth #6</strong>: So Google Authenticator is a free and open-source, but does anyone else use it?<br /><strong>Reality</strong>: Yes! You can use Google Authenticator to do two-factor authentication with <a href=\"http://helpdesk.lastpass.com/security-options/google-authenticator/\">LastPass</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-authenticator/\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=66910\">Dropbox</a>, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/mfa/virtual_mfa_applications/\">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/ga_login\">Drupal</a>, <a href=\"https://stripe.com/blog/two-step-verification\">Stripe</a>, and <a href=\"http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Enabling_Multifactor_Authentication\">DreamHost</a>, or even use a <a href=\"http://static.yubico.com/var/uploads/pdfs/Howto_GmailYubiKey.pdf\">YubiKey</a> device. There&#8217;s even a <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/\">Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)</a> so you can add two-factor authentication to any PAM-enabled application. That means you can use <a href=\"http://www.mnxsolutions.com/security/two-factor-ssh-with-google-authenticator.html\">Google Authenticator to add two-factor authentication to SSH</a>, for example.</p><p>One last tip: use a different password on Gmail/Google than on other services. If you reuse a password and a hacker cracks into one company, they can <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/792/\">use the same password</a> to crack into your Google account. </p><p>Please don&#8217;t wait to turn on 2-step verification. It&#8217;s not that hard, and it will really protect your account.

Hi, the usual reason why a site’s PageRank drops by 30-50% like this is because the site violates our quality guidelines by selling links that pass PageRank.

In Google’s world, we take paid links that pass PageRank as seriously as Amazon would take paid reviews without disclosure or as your newspaper would treat a reporter who was paid to link to a website in an article without disclosing the payment.</p><p>In particular, earlier this year on [website] we saw links labeled as sponsored that passed PageRank, such as a link like [example link]. That’s a clear violation of Google’s quality guidelines, and it’s the reason that [website]‘s PageRank as well as our trust in the website has declined.</p><p>In fact, we received a outside spam report about your site. The spam report passed on an email from a link seller offering to sell links on multiple pages on [website] based on their PageRank. Some pages mentioned in that email continue to have unusual links to this day. For example [example url] has a section labeled “PARTNER LINKS” which links to [linkbuyer].</p><p>So my advice would be to investigate how paid links that pass PageRank ended up on [website]: who put them there, are any still up, and to investigate whether someone at the [newspaper] received money to post paid links that pass PageRank without disclosing that payment, e.g. using ambiguous labeling such as “Partner links.” That’s definitely where I would dig.</p><p>After that investigation is complete and any paid links that pass PageRank are removed, the site’s webmaster can do a reconsideration request using Google’s free webmaster tools console at <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webmasters/\">google.com/webmasters</a>. I would include as much detail as you can about what you found out about the paid links. That will help us assess how things look going forward.</p><p>Sincerely,<br />

That&#8217;s a clear violation of Google&#8217;s quality guidelines, and it&#8217;s the reason that [website]&#8216;s PageRank as well as our trust in the website has declined.</p><p>In fact, we received a outside spam report about your site. The spam report passed on an email from a link seller offering to sell links on multiple pages on [website] based on their PageRank. Some pages mentioned in that email continue to have unusual links to this day. For example [example url] has a section labeled &#8220;PARTNER LINKS&#8221; which links to [linkbuyer].</p><p>So my advice would be to investigate how paid links that pass PageRank ended up on [website]: who put them there, are any still up, and to investigate whether someone at the [newspaper] received money to post paid links that pass PageRank without disclosing that payment, e.g. using ambiguous labeling such as &#8220;Partner links.&#8221; That&#8217;s definitely where I would dig.</p><p>After that investigation is complete and any paid links that pass PageRank are removed, the site&#8217;s webmaster can do a reconsideration request using Google&#8217;s free webmaster tools console at <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webmasters/\">google.com/webmasters</a>. I would include as much detail as you can about what you found out about the paid links. That will help us assess how things look going forward.</p><p>Sincerely,<br />
Matt
