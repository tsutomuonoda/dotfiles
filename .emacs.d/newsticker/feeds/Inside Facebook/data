The new requirements may seem daunting for PMDs not focused primarily on paid media, but compliance will yield a major benefit by allowing PMDs to concentrate on their core competencies through the pursuit of smart partnerships.<br /><span id=\"more-80314\"></span><br />
Inside Facebook recently <a href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2013/03/04/facebook-creates-new-requirements-for-pmd-program/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> that Facebook will be seeking developers that can advise marketers on ad spend, even if they’re primarily focused on areas like Pages, Apps or Insights. There is no question why Facebook is making this play: Ads-focused PMDs have helped establish the PMD program as one of Facebook’s significant revenue drivers. However, by giving unpaid media developers the option to partner with an ads provider, many PMDs will be able to concentrate their efforts within their own areas of expertise, rather than delve into unchartered territory. Top-notch page management tools will be able to add new features, as will analytics-driven tools, custom integration developers and so on.</p><p>Facebook is also looking to PMDs for continued innovation around its various APIs. From a product perspective, each “badge” area of the PMD marketplace is saturated with technologies that sometimes offer strikingly similar capabilities. Ask any agency exec and they’ll likely contend that it has become virtually impossible to differentiate between some PMD offerings &#8212; and they are right!  In addition to demonstrating “clear proprietary value above and beyond Facebook&#8217;s native tools,” the PMD team has set higher standards for both current PMDs and new applicants with respect to quality and time. Satisfying these requirements will bring out the best in PMDs&#8217; products, and as a result, help marketers.</p><p>Clearly the most impactful of the updates is that all PMDs will now need to either build ad tech to support their unpaid media technology or partner with an ads provider to boost content. PMDs that aren’t resourced to build an ads product will need to find an open platform with which they can integrate while enabling them to reach new customers via partnership. Integrating apps into an open platform where marketers can collaborate and work with PMDs across all four badged areas will help customers streamline their Paid, Owned, and Earned efforts. These integrations will also create a robust environment where brands, agencies, and publishers can access the best technologies and execute stellar Facebook marketing campaigns.</p><p>It is clear that the PMD program is taking steps to preserve its community of best-in-class developers focused on making social marketing easier and more effective. If this community is going to flourish, then let’s work together to do it right.</p><p><i>Greg is Vice President of Business Development at <a href=\"http://shift.com\" target=\"_blank\">SHIFT</a>, the leading collaboration platform for marketers.

However, Facebook wants to promote cross-platform game development so it will give them the benefit of mobile bookmarks. With fewer apps being included in the bookmarks menu, the few cross-platform games that do appear there could see more traffic than they were before.</p><p>The change goes into effect June 5.<br /><span id=\"more-80283\"></span><br />
Facebook introduced mobile bookmarks <a href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/09/29/facebook-mobile-app-platform-documentation-html5-spartan/\" target=\"_blank\">in 2011</a>, along with other features to improve distribution for HTML5 and native iOS apps. Android support came later. As we pointed out <a href=\"http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2011/10/10/facebook-mobile-platform-ios-html5/\" target=\"_blank\">at launch</a>, app bookmarks are buried a layer deep in the Facebook app, so there wasn&#8217;t much reason for users to launch apps this way instead of directly from their phone. The primary way mobile apps get installs and re-engagement from Facebook is through News Feed. Now with mobile app install ads and more engaging Open Graph stories, developers have more effective ways to drive people to their games and apps.</p><p>Facebook said in its blog post:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;This is not a breaking change, as no code changes are necessary, but we wanted to give developers time to consider alternative ways to reengage users. News Feed remains the top driver of discovery and re-engagement for mobile apps and we are focused on making this the best experience available across mobile and web. You can learn about our other mobile channels <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/mobile/\">here</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InsideFacebook/~4/sCuXr4z6Gl0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (media:content ((url .

These changes make comments on page posts more similar to Facebook’s comments plugin for third-party sites, which have had threaded conversations and a ranking algorithm since <a href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/03/01/comments-box-plugin-relevance/\" target=\"_blank\">March 2011</a>. On posts by pages and public figures, there can be dozens or even thousands of comments, and users cannot tag and mention other fans they aren’t friends with. The new system could improve engagement on these posts since high-quality comments will be surfaced up top and users will be notified when someone replies to their comment. Admins can also down-rank posts without deleting them.</p><p>&#8220;We think this update will allow for easier management of conversations around posts, which is a better experience for people interacting with pages and public figure profiles,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>The new comments are not yet available for mobile or via the API</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-80249\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2012-11-12-at-1.06.40-PM\" src=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2012-11-12-at-1.06.40-PM-500x359.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"359\" /></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-80250\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2012-11-12-at-1.07.04-PM\" src=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2012-11-12-at-1.07.04-PM-500x435.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"435\" /></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InsideFacebook/~4/iztGckrUCjI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (media:content ((url .

However, Facebook wants to promote cross-platform game development so it will give them the benefit of mobile bookmarks. With fewer apps being included in the bookmarks menu, the few cross-platform games that do appear there could see more traffic than they were before.</p><p>The change goes into effect June 5.<br /><span id=\"more-80283\"></span><br />
Facebook introduced mobile bookmarks <a href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/09/29/facebook-mobile-app-platform-documentation-html5-spartan/\" target=\"_blank\">in 2011</a>, along with other features to improve distribution for HTML5 and native iOS apps. Android support came later. As we pointed out <a href=\"http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2011/10/10/facebook-mobile-platform-ios-html5/\" target=\"_blank\">at launch</a>, app bookmarks are buried a layer deep in the Facebook app, so there wasn’t much reason for users to launch apps this way instead of directly from their phone. The primary way mobile apps get installs and re-engagement from Facebook is through News Feed.

Facebook introduced mobile bookmarks <a href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/09/29/facebook-mobile-app-platform-documentation-html5-spartan/\" target=\"_blank\">in 2011</a>, along with other features to improve distribution for HTML5 and native iOS apps. Android support came later. As we pointed out <a href=\"http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2011/10/10/facebook-mobile-platform-ios-html5/\" target=\"_blank\">at launch</a>, app bookmarks are buried a layer deep in the Facebook app, so there wasn&#8217;t much reason for users to launch apps this way instead of directly from their phone. The primary way mobile apps get installs and re-engagement from Facebook is through News Feed. Now with mobile app install ads and more engaging Open Graph stories, developers have more effective ways to drive people to their games and apps.</p><p>Facebook said in its blog post:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;This is not a breaking change, as no code changes are necessary, but we wanted to give developers time to consider alternative ways to reengage users.
