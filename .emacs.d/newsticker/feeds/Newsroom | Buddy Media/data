Last week, NYC was home to the <a href=\"http://mashable.com/sgs/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Good Summit</a>, where this topic was the star. But you didn’t have to be on Manhattan’s Upper East Side to join the conversation or learn how to do some social good of your own.</p><p>CEOs, Nobel Prize winners, government officials, celebrities and the public from all over the world shared their stories, ideas and insights on social good across social media during the summit, bringing in <strong>98,617</strong> conversations. What does this mean? Yes, social good is a good thing. But moreover, organizations across the world are realizing the opportunity and embracing it.</p><p>How can your organization embrace social good? Consider these ideas.</p><h2>Apply your Data</h2><p>One of the most retweeted quotes at the conference was from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/todd_Park\">Todd Park</a>, Chief Technology Officer at the White House:</p><p>“It’s about turning government into a platform for open innovation. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Data by itself is useless</span>. I can’t feed my baby daughter data, as much as I’d love to because I love data. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">It’s only useful if you apply it to create an actual public benefit.</span> You need appliers — you need entrepreneurs to know data’s available in order for them to turn it into awesomeness.”</p><p>Social media provides us with a slew of data. Dissect it to pull out the insights that will benefit your community. For instance, through social media monitoring, you may uncover cries for help in your community. It could even be as simple as a <a href=\"http://www.buddymedia.com/newsroom/2012/09/how-a-facebook-ad-helped-find-a-missing-cat/\">missing cat</a> or larger issues around poverty. Uncover these stories and find ways to get involved.</p><h2>Involve your Community</h2><p>During the conference, the White House Council on Women and Girls launched the <a href=\"http://equalfutures.challenge.gov/\">Equal Futures Partnership</a>, where individuals can enter a contest to create apps that help promote civic education and inspire girls to serve as leaders. Consider how social media and technology can serve as a means for the public to get involved in your efforts.</p><h2>Reach Out to Leaders</h2><p>There are influential voices in your community that may come in the form of bloggers or super Twitter users. They have opinions, ideas and a following. By connecting and developing relationships with these social media leaders, you can further spread your message and have a supportive voice in the community.</p><p>As Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, shared at the summit, “The Internet is allowing for us to really experience people in some of the most distant places in the world — as other people just like us. So get to know people, seek out bloggers from a country you’re kind of curious about. It’s about building empathy and breaking through to the point of recognizing people as people.”</p><p><em>What opportunities for social good are apparent in your community?

But the entry method was unique: instead of filling out paper forms or even using a laptop to enter, Glantz directed attendees to pull out their phones and point their browsers to <a href=\"bit.ly/DreamforcePCH\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/DreamforcePCH</a>. Once there, attendees filled out a simple form entering them into the competition.</p><p><a href=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Social-media-sweepstakes-PCH.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18771\" title=\"Social-media-sweepstakes-PCH\" src=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Social-media-sweepstakes-PCH.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"590\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>Glantz understands the power of social sweepstakes, and its potential as a digital complement to e-mail.</p><p>“Sweepstakes and other promotions, when properly targeted, are a great way to motivate handraisers and fans for your brand and your offer.  Using these promotions to drive viral marketing has long been a foundational strategy for digital marketers, but [Congressional legislation] CAN-SPAM limits what you can do in the world of email,\" Glantz said. \"Tying your promotion to the social graph, especially when leveraging the ubiquity of mobile devices, is a natural and powerful new move to extend your reach.”</p><p><a href=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/social-sweepstakes-PCH-sharing.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18775\" title=\"social-sweepstakes-PCH-sharing\" src=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/social-sweepstakes-PCH-sharing.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"590\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>Once users share their entry into the sweepstakes, that content can gain viral lift as it appears in the Facebook News Feed, ticker and timeline:</p><p><a href=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mobile-sweepstakes-ticker.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-18779 alignnone\" title=\"mobile-sweepstakes-ticker\" src=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mobile-sweepstakes-ticker.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"531\" height=\"338\" /></a></p><p>When friends of entrants see the sweepstakes shared across Facebook, they can click back to enter themselves, either directly on Facebook from their desktop computers or via the mobile entry form. The link automatically optimizes based on the user's device.</p><p>For brands like PCH, social sweepstakes provide a new way to reach audiences on a medium where people already spend so much time.</p><p>“As we see our mobile audience grow, we are leveraging dedicated sweepstakes more for that audience specifically.  They are highly engaged and they have access to our content wherever they are and whenever they want it,\" Glantz said. \"That’s very attractive to us and we are more than happy to provide our audience with more of the winning opportunities that they are looking for.”</p><p>The ultimate goal for social sweepstakes should be happy users and a happy brand.

How long, you ask? In their book, “<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_History_of_Sweepstakes.html?id=SYYcVYsbQFIC\">The History of Sweepstakes</a>,” Lawrence Curtin and Karen Bernardo date the sweepstakes all the way back to the Greeks and the Trojans. In fact, King Menelaus was said to have won Helen of Troy’s hand through the casting of lots.</p><p>More recently, social media marketers have used sweepstakes and contests as a way to collect information and entice users to engage with social presences. Though <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/facebook-q2-earnings-and-stats-revenue-1-18b-955m-monthlies-552m-dailies-543m-mobile-monthlies/\">Facebook recently announced 543 million monthly users access the site on mobile</a>, sweepstakes and contests have been practically non-existent on phones and tablets.</p><p>But as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmglantz\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Glantz, VP/GM of Publishers Clearing House Online</a>, showed at Dreamforce 2012, the mobile sweepstakes is not a pipe dream; instead, it’s available now.</p><p>At Glantz’s session, co-presented with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaindl\" target=\"_blank\">Salesforce Marketing Cloud’s Michael Jaindl</a>, attendees were given a chance to win two $50 cash prizes or a $100 cash prizes from PCH in a sweepstakes powered by the Salesforce Marketing Cloud. But the entry method was unique: instead of filling out paper forms or even using a laptop to enter, Glantz directed attendees to pull out their phones and point their browsers to <a href=\"bit.ly/DreamforcePCH\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/DreamforcePCH</a>. Once there, attendees filled out a simple form entering them into the competition.</p><p><a href=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Social-media-sweepstakes-PCH.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18771\" title=\"Social-media-sweepstakes-PCH\" src=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Social-media-sweepstakes-PCH.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"590\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>Glantz understands the power of social sweepstakes, and its potential as a digital complement to e-mail.</p><p>“Sweepstakes and other promotions, when properly targeted, are a great way to motivate handraisers and fans for your brand and your offer.  Using these promotions to drive viral marketing has long been a foundational strategy for digital marketers, but [Congressional legislation] CAN-SPAM limits what you can do in the world of email,\" Glantz said. \"Tying your promotion to the social graph, especially when leveraging the ubiquity of mobile devices, is a natural and powerful new move to extend your reach.”</p><p><a href=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/social-sweepstakes-PCH-sharing.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18775\" title=\"social-sweepstakes-PCH-sharing\" src=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/social-sweepstakes-PCH-sharing.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"590\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>Once users share their entry into the sweepstakes, that content can gain viral lift as it appears in the Facebook News Feed, ticker and timeline:</p><p><a href=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mobile-sweepstakes-ticker.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-18779 alignnone\" title=\"mobile-sweepstakes-ticker\" src=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mobile-sweepstakes-ticker.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"531\" height=\"338\" /></a></p><p>When friends of entrants see the sweepstakes shared across Facebook, they can click back to enter themselves, either directly on Facebook from their desktop computers or via the mobile entry form. The link automatically optimizes based on the user's device.</p><p>For brands like PCH, social sweepstakes provide a new way to reach audiences on a medium where people already spend so much time.</p><p>“As we see our mobile audience grow, we are leveraging dedicated sweepstakes more for that audience specifically.  They are highly engaged and they have access to our content wherever they are and whenever they want it,\" Glantz said. \"That’s very attractive to us and we are more than happy to provide our audience with more of the winning opportunities that they are looking for.”</p><p>The ultimate goal for social sweepstakes should be happy users and a happy brand.

In fact, King Menelaus was said to have won Helen of Troy’s hand through the casting of lots.</p><p>More recently, social media marketers have used sweepstakes and contests as a way to collect information and entice users to engage with social presences. Though <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/facebook-q2-earnings-and-stats-revenue-1-18b-955m-monthlies-552m-dailies-543m-mobile-monthlies/\">Facebook recently announced 543 million monthly users access the site on mobile</a>, sweepstakes and contests have been practically non-existent on phones and tablets.</p><p>But as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmglantz\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Glantz, VP/GM of Publishers Clearing House Online</a>, showed at Dreamforce 2012, the mobile sweepstakes is not a pipe dream; instead, it’s available now.</p><p>At Glantz’s session, co-presented with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaindl\" target=\"_blank\">Salesforce Marketing Cloud’s Michael Jaindl</a>, attendees were given a chance to win two $50 cash prizes or a $100 cash prizes from PCH in a sweepstakes powered by the Salesforce Marketing Cloud. But the entry method was unique: instead of filling out paper forms or even using a laptop to enter, Glantz directed attendees to pull out their phones and point their browsers to <a href=\"bit.ly/DreamforcePCH\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/DreamforcePCH</a>. Once there, attendees filled out a simple form entering them into the competition.</p><p><a href=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Social-media-sweepstakes-PCH.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18771\" title=\"Social-media-sweepstakes-PCH\" src=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Social-media-sweepstakes-PCH.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"590\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>Glantz understands the power of social sweepstakes, and its potential as a digital complement to e-mail.</p><p>“Sweepstakes and other promotions, when properly targeted, are a great way to motivate handraisers and fans for your brand and your offer.  Using these promotions to drive viral marketing has long been a foundational strategy for digital marketers, but [Congressional legislation] CAN-SPAM limits what you can do in the world of email,\" Glantz said. \"Tying your promotion to the social graph, especially when leveraging the ubiquity of mobile devices, is a natural and powerful new move to extend your reach.”</p><p><a href=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/social-sweepstakes-PCH-sharing.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18775\" title=\"social-sweepstakes-PCH-sharing\" src=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/social-sweepstakes-PCH-sharing.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"590\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>Once users share their entry into the sweepstakes, that content can gain viral lift as it appears in the Facebook News Feed, ticker and timeline:</p><p><a href=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mobile-sweepstakes-ticker.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-18779 alignnone\" title=\"mobile-sweepstakes-ticker\" src=\"/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mobile-sweepstakes-ticker.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"531\" height=\"338\" /></a></p><p>When friends of entrants see the sweepstakes shared across Facebook, they can click back to enter themselves, either directly on Facebook from their desktop computers or via the mobile entry form. The link automatically optimizes based on the user's device.</p><p>For brands like PCH, social sweepstakes provide a new way to reach audiences on a medium where people already spend so much time.</p><p>“As we see our mobile audience grow, we are leveraging dedicated sweepstakes more for that audience specifically.  They are highly engaged and they have access to our content wherever they are and whenever they want it,\" Glantz said. \"That’s very attractive to us and we are more than happy to provide our audience with more of the winning opportunities that they are looking for.”</p><p>The ultimate goal for social sweepstakes should be happy users and a happy brand.
