I understand why some people like it. It&#8217;s great to have collective code ownership. It&#8217;s great to have conversations about what the code should look like before the code is actually written. And it&#8217;s great to have a collaborative work environment where people are always learning from each other.</p><p>But a LOT of people are turned off by pair programming. It&#8217;s too easy for the person who isn&#8217;t typing to just zone out. Some (many?) developers just don&#8217;t enjoy pair programming as a practice. It generates a LOT of noise (imagine 5 pairs of people talking at once). And no great internet company that I&#8217;m aware of seems to do it heavily. In fact, the biggest advocates of pair programming are often consulting shops (who charge by the programmer-hour and therefore have an obvious conflict of interest).</p><p>Trying to figure out how to get some of the benefits of pair programming without the drawbacks, we stumbled onto the &#8220;buddy system&#8221; at SlideShare. The rule is pretty simple: if you&#8217;re going to be doing something dangerous and complicated (like swimming or writing production ruby code) you probably shouldn&#8217;t be doing it alone.</p><p>So developers at slideshare just tend to work together on stuff. They don&#8217;t work on the same code … there&#8217;s always a bunch of different files that will need to be edited or created for implementing a new feature. But they&#8217;ll work on the new feature or bug together, usually in ad-hoc teams of two or three. </p><p>Some of the benefits of this approach are:<br />
* Architecture and overall code structure always has a consensus of at least two behind it. If there&#8217;s a disagreement, it will be audible and the rest of the team can get involved as needed until consensus has been achieved. This dramatically reduces rework caused by one developer making an architectural decision that the rest of the team doesn&#8217;t agree with.<br />
* There&#8217;s always someone available who can code-review your code and already understands the context of your code. This is crucial, because we do code-reviews before every checkin. And an uninformed code review doesn&#8217;t have value (it&#8217;s likely to be a &#8220;lgtm&#8221;, or &#8220;looks good to me&#8221;).<br />
* There are always at least two people always understand a given section of the code base.<br />
* The work feels a lot less lonely. There&#8217;s someone else deeply involved in the same problem that you are facing. It&#8217;s easy to learn from them because you&#8217;re working together.<br />
* You still get lot&#8217;s of &#8220;me&#8221; time, with just you and the compiler. Lot&#8217;s of engineers got into programming because they enjoy quietly writing code, and there&#8217;s no need to take that away from people as long as enough collaboration is also happening.<br />
* The collective nature of the work makes it more likely that peer pressure will keep developers from cutting corners on unit tests or other good practices that your team has adopted.</p><p>Just to be fair, there are a couple of disadvantages:<br />
* Not all problems are big enough for two people to work on. Simple bug fixes, for example, should just be grabbed and worked on.<br />
* Unlike pair programming, some code will typically be written before a second person looks at it. So you miss out on getting the feedback as early as possible (when the code is most easy to change and no one has emotional investment in it yet)</p><p>Overall, though, we&#8217;ve found the buddy system to be a remarkably fun and productive way of working. </p><p>Does this style of working sound fun to you? We&#8217;re always looking for great engineers, and can train you in Ruby if you&#8217;re already comfortable programming in other interpreted languages and are comfortable with Linux.

What it does is make various noises in the slideshare office when a new subscription user signs up, cancels, or renews. It also makes sounds when a build fails, when a deployment to production starts, and when a deployment to production is successfully completed, and for when the site goes down. Sounds are a really pleasant and natural way to signal attention-worthy events!</p><p>The system was almost embarassingly easy to make (zero coding required):<br />
1) First we configured the systems we wanted alerts from (our subscription billing vendor, our deployment system, our continuous integration system, and out uptime monitoring system) to send emails to a particular gmail account when events that we want the team to know about happen.<br />
2) Then we hooked up an old windows desktop to a cambridge soundworks speaker system, and configured outlook to make various sounds when it receives emails that have particular strings in the subject. Basically, we&#8217;re using email like a lowest-common-denominator enterprise message bus.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of what the outlook config looks like:<br /><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6231/6235542017_aa156819c9_z.jpg\" alt=\"outlook configuration settings\" /></p><p>And here&#8217;s the computer and sound system.<br /><img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6042/6235599617_3caf62618e.jpg\" alt=\"picture of computer and sound system\"/><br />

We all know whenever the build fails or when there&#8217;s a deployment in progress. And if we get a rush of subscriptions or cancellations we immediately investigate to figure out what we&#8217;re doing right or wrong. Plus, it&#8217;s great for team morale to hear the steady flow of renewals coming in throughout the day.</p><p>Here&#8217;s some of the sounds that we&#8217;re using, and the events that they represent:<br />
Subscription renewal: <a href=\"http://www.freesound.org/people/juskiddink/sounds/86773/\">hit the sales gong</a><br />
Subscription cancelled?: <a href=\"http://www.freesound.org/people/Benboncan/sounds/73581/\">Sad Trombone sound</a><br />
New Subscription: <a href=\"http://www.freesound.org/people/milton./sounds/73701/\">Slot machine jackpot</a><br />
Deploying: <a href=\"http://www.freesound.org/people/neonaeon/sounds/49477/\">Sound the trumpets</a><br />

Getting the fonts and the text placement to look exactly right across all supported browsers was a real engineering challenge. So we’re happy to finally be able to see this on SlideShare.net.</p><p>Ditching Flash for HTML5 feels like the right choice for us for a number of engineering reasons.</p><ol><li>The exact same HTML5 documents work on the iPhone / iPad, Android  phones/tablets, and modern desktop browsers. This is great from an operations perspective. This saves us from extra storage costs, and maximizes the cache hit ration on our CDN (since a desktop request fills the cache for a mobile request, and vice-versa). It’s also great from a software engineering perspective, because we can put all our energy into supporting one format and making it really great.</li><li>Documents load 30% faster and are 40% smaller. ‘Nuff said on that front, faster is ALWAYS better.</li><li>The documents are semantic and accessible. Google can parse it and index the documents, and so can any other bot, scraper, spider, or screen-reader. This means that you can write code that does interesting things with the text on the slideshare pages. You can even copy and paste text from a SlideShare document, something that was always a pain with Flash.</li></ol><h2>What were the most challenging parts of this project? Glad you asked.</h2><p><strong>Font Conversion</strong></p><p>Font handling was the biggest challenge. We had to build support for rendering arbitrary fonts in your browser that are not available on the client.  If you invent a new font, and upload a pdf that uses it, it should still render perfectly on SlideShare. Whoa!</p><p><strong>Text Placement</strong></p><p>Placing the text is very tricky due to differences between different browsers, differences between fonts (handling ligature), and several other complexities. To illustrate: the PDF coordinate system starts in the bottom left.  HTML starts in the top left.  Pdfs use points, HTML you get your choice of unit, however no two browsers agree on how precise any particular unit is! The largest problem we face with placement is normalization.  We spent a lot of time finding that magic combination of em’s, percentages and zoom which gives us correct placement across the web.</p><p><strong>Error Handling</strong></p><p>We also built a system to find out when there is variance between an image of the HTML output and an image generated directly from the document. If there’s more than a certain amount of variance, we consider that an error and we won’t serve that page as HTML5. Instead we’ll serve a png image of the page when that page is requested. There was some hard-core computer vision involved in the error-handling system. The way we look at it, we want to serve HTML5, but not at the expense of a document that looks bad and disappoints the author.</p><p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></p><p>Our conversion stack runs on Amazon EC2 and is configured and managed by Puppet. We’ve been using EC2 for our conversion stack for years, so we’re old hands at that stuff. For this new system, we started out with a number of different types of servers (a font extractor, a font generator, etc). What we found out is that the coordination time between different machines (using Amazon SQS) and the IO time (using S3) were a huge bottleneck. So our architecture for this new system is more remenicent of the <a href=\"http://techblog.netflix.com/2010/12/5-lessons-weve-learned-using-aws.html\">netflix “Rambo” architecture</a>. Each box is a self-contained system that can do the entire job of conversion, with no help from anyone.</p><p>As we speak, an army of hundreds of Amazon EC2 instances is crunching away at converting the *millions* and *millions* of presentations and documents that have been uploaded to slideshare over the last 5 years to HTML5. New documents will automatically be converted to HTML5 from now on. We hope to have the transition complete by the end of the year (maybe sooner, but no promises!). At that point all slideshare content will be served as Html5.</p><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>This is a work in progress … we are betting the company on HTML 5, and are going to continue to invest in the HTML5 conversion stack and JavaScript player technologies that we’re releasing today. Some of the next things on our plate include</p><ol><li> Handling Z-indexes (objects occluding other objects) better</li><li>continued development on our font extraction techology</li><li>Adding some features that we just weren’t able to port to our html5 player in time for this launch, like embedded video and synchronized audio.</li></ol><p><strong>Obligatory recruiting pitch</strong></p><p>If you’re a developer and like working on this kind of stuff, SlideShare wants to talk to you!

* There’s always someone available who can code-review your code and already understands the context of your code. This is crucial, because we do code-reviews before every checkin. And an uninformed code review doesn’t have value (it’s likely to be a “lgtm”, or “looks good to me”).<br />
* There are always at least two people always understand a given section of the code base.<br />
* The work feels a lot less lonely. There’s someone else deeply involved in the same problem that you are facing. It’s easy to learn from them because you’re working together.<br />
* You still get lot’s of “me” time, with just you and the compiler. Lot’s of engineers got into programming because they enjoy quietly writing code, and there’s no need to take that away from people as long as enough collaboration is also happening.<br />

We are now rendering presentations and documents using <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/html5\">HTML5 instead of Flash</a>. This is a milestone. 5 years ago, it was impossible to build something like SlideShare or Youtube without Flash. But the web has finally caught up.</p><p>This project was the biggest engineering project in SlideShare’s history. A lot of SlideShare engineering has been working on this around-the-clock for the last six months. As we have learnt over the past five years, people are picky about how their presentations look. Getting the fonts and the text placement to look exactly right across all supported browsers was a real engineering challenge. So we’re happy to finally be able to see this on SlideShare.net.</p><p>Ditching Flash for HTML5 feels like the right choice for us for a number of engineering reasons.</p><ol><li>The exact same HTML5 documents work on the iPhone / iPad, Android  phones/tablets, and modern desktop browsers. This is great from an operations perspective. This saves us from extra storage costs, and maximizes the cache hit ration on our CDN (since a desktop request fills the cache for a mobile request, and vice-versa). It’s also great from a software engineering perspective, because we can put all our energy into supporting one format and making it really great.</li><li>Documents load 30% faster and are 40% smaller. ‘Nuff said on that front, faster is ALWAYS better.</li><li>The documents are semantic and accessible. Google can parse it and index the documents, and so can any other bot, scraper, spider, or screen-reader. This means that you can write code that does interesting things with the text on the slideshare pages. You can even copy and paste text from a SlideShare document, something that was always a pain with Flash.</li></ol><h2>What were the most challenging parts of this project?

We are now rendering presentations and documents using <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/html5\">HTML5 instead of Flash</a>. This is a milestone. 5 years ago, it was impossible to build something like SlideShare or Youtube without Flash. But the web has finally caught up.</p><p>This project was the biggest engineering project in SlideShare’s history. A lot of SlideShare engineering has been working on this around-the-clock for the last six months. As we have learnt over the past five years, people are picky about how their presentations look. Getting the fonts and the text placement to look exactly right across all supported browsers was a real engineering challenge. So we’re happy to finally be able to see this on SlideShare.net.</p><p>Ditching Flash for HTML5 feels like the right choice for us for a number of engineering reasons.</p><ol><li>The exact same HTML5 documents work on the iPhone / iPad, Android  phones/tablets, and modern desktop browsers. This is great from an operations perspective. This saves us from extra storage costs, and maximizes the cache hit ration on our CDN (since a desktop request fills the cache for a mobile request, and vice-versa). It’s also great from a software engineering perspective, because we can put all our energy into supporting one format and making it really great.</li><li>Documents load 30% faster and are 40% smaller. ‘Nuff said on that front, faster is ALWAYS better.</li><li>The documents are semantic and accessible. Google can parse it and index the documents, and so can any other bot, scraper, spider, or screen-reader. This means that you can write code that does interesting things with the text on the slideshare pages. You can even copy and paste text from a SlideShare document, something that was always a pain with Flash.</li></ol><h2>What were the most challenging parts of this project?
