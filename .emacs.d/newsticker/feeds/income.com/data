That being said, there&#8217;s a huge consumer market for beer in the country, supplying a demand that is unlikely to ever be quenched.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> wants brewski-brewing business owners to know they can succeed even with the presence of high-profile competitors like Miller and Budweiser. Local beers are about a trendy as local eats and increasingly, entrepreneurs are seeing opening their own brewery as a route to<a href=\"http://income.com/67/3-keys-for-starting-a-successful-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\">small-business success</a>.</p><p>However, entrepreneurs should know starting a micro-brewery can be a very different process compared to what some serial entrepreneurs may be accustomed to. You&#8217;ll need to develop industry knowledge, keep regulatory compliance a top priority and make inroads in the local market.</p><p>Do it right and soon enough consumers be foaming at the mouth for your suds.</p><h2><strong>Beer Love Doesn&#8217;t Always Translate To Knowledge</strong></h2><p>Every drinker on the planet fashions him or herself out to be a connoisseur on all things beer. However, unless you know the difference between Galena hops and Glacier hops, your monkey chug record won&#8217;t prove to be of much assistance in preparing operations. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zM5P5iOKzI\" target=\"_blank\">Nobody wants to end up like this guy</a>.</p><p>There&#8217;s a lot of education and street smarts that go into crafting the right brew, things that can only be picked up through practice and experience. Owners often have to brew a number of batches before they can get their recipe for a Belgian white ale down pat. Brewing as a hobby helps, but oftentimes, entrepreneurs are mostly involved in the day-to-day operations of running a startup. You might need to bring on an expert brewer for some help in getting things stirring.</p><p>But don&#8217;t let that discourage you. Take for instance the case of Curt Cameron, <a href=\"http://www.hartfordbusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130107/PRINTEDITION/301049982\" target=\"_blank\">a serial entrepreneur who bought and runs his own brewery</a>. In a profile piece printed in The Hartford Business Journal, Cameron said he had previously <a href=\"http://income.com/1887/green-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business-landscaping/\" target=\"_blank\">run a landscaping business</a>, even owned liquor stores, but had no brewing skills or experience on his resume. However, that didn&#8217;t stop him netting an estimated $2 million in 2012, six years after he bought his brewery and transformed it into a local fixture.</p><h2><strong>Laws, Regulations Vary By State</strong></h2><p>While an all-beer diet might not be the most healthy option, beer is in essence, food. And as such, it is a stringently regulated commodity for consumption, making regulatory compliance a top-of-mind issue for startup breweries. Making matters somewhat more complicated for entrepreneurs are the <a href=\"http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/government-affairs/self-distribution-laws\" target=\"_blank\">varying levels and language of brewery regulations found across states</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/start-minibrewery-12964.html\" target=\"_blank\">As suggested by The Houston Chronicle</a>, it&#8217;s imperative you know what laws and regulations your state keeps in regard to production and distribution of alcohol. You must also register your beer with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in order to be considered legally allowed to sell your brew.</p><p>The Chronicle also advises brewery startups that they&#8217;ll need to obtain all necessary permits at a local and state level, including a license to sell alcohol.</p><h2><strong>Niche Beers Sell In Local Markets</strong></h2><p>Of course, the most fun you can have in starting up your brewery is deciding which beers you want to brew. However, make sure you choose a beer style that will be profitable in your local area. For instance, if there&#8217;s an abundance of standard ales in your target market, why not give consumers a different option with an Indian pale ale. Likewise, if light-colored pilsners dominate in your area, you might be better off making and selling darker stouts.</p><p>Always keep an eye on the local market, because before you can achieve national recognition, you need to make a name for yourself in your town or city first. Heed the story of Goose Island Brewery. The Chicago-based business has made its 312 wheat ale &#8211; named so after one of Chicago&#8217;s telephone area codes &#8211; a popular beer on the national stage. Maryland brewery Dogfish Head has also made its beer a household name after working to establish itself in the local market.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> knows many entrepreneurs like to kick back and have a cold one, but many others don&#8217;t know they can make a cool buck off beer. Craft breweries stand to make big business out of the growing consumer market for local products. Keep in mind you&#8217;ll need some prior experience or knowledge of the industry, federal and state approval and an idea of how you will appeal to the local market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/forum/forum.php\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Community_banner.png\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.mylanderpages.com/income/howtocreateawebsiteebook_4\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-577\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/howtocreateawebsiteebook1.png\" width=\"641\" height=\"123\" /></a></p><p>The post <a href=\"http://income.com/1942/how-to-run-your-own-small-business-brewery/\">How To Run Your Own Small-Business Brewery</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://income.com\">income.com</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/income/YOKa/~4/NEP4OJd-Leg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://income.com/1942/how-to-run-your-own-small-business-brewery/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://income.com/1942/how-to-run-your-own-small-business-brewery/")) (item nil (title nil "Senior Living And Care: 2 Ideas For Starting A Small Business") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/income/YOKa/~3/6iH5-hPObjo/") (comments nil "http://income.com/1937/senior-living-and-care-2-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business/#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 21 Mar 2013 14:31:50 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Tedd Johnson") (category nil "Articles") (category nil "Ideas For Starting A Small Business") (category nil "Small Business") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Baby boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, constitute a major percentage of the U.S. population. Those born in the early stages of the movement turned 65, a common retirement age, in 2011.</p><p>The aging population presents some complications &#8211; a talent gap in the workforce as boomers head for retirement &#8211; but also a number of opportunities for entrepreneurs with ideas for starting a small business that serves the needs of seniors.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> has always believed in deferring to our elders, but now it may be time to make some money while having to sit through grandpa&#8217;s umpteenth telling of that time him and Jimmy from the block sold newspapers for a nickel - A nickel!</p><p>There&#8217;s a number of options to go with when trying to think of <a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/small-business-cents/starting-senior-care-business\" target=\"_blank\">ideas for starting a small business that caters to senior</a> living and care demands. Retirement communities and care services aren&#8217;t the only possibility. Can&#8217;t remember the last time you set down your smartphone? Seminars on technology training are a hot ticket. Got a lead &#8211; but still steady &#8211; foot? Senior transport services may be your calling.</p><p>There&#8217;s more to small businesses designed to serve senior citizens than tapioca pudding and re-runs of the Lawrence Welk show, and entrepreneurs should <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/start-nonmedical-senior-home-care-business-not-franchise-opportunity-14278.html\" target=\"_blank\">investigate startups in the industry</a> if they want to take advantage of a booming trend.</p><h2><strong>Transportation Services</strong></h2><p>Seniors with prescription lenses as thick as the phonebook aren&#8217;t exactly the most suitable drivers on the road. That makes getting around a hassle for many that need to get to doctor appointments, general shopping and meetups with friends. Further exacerbating the situation is the fact family members often live separately and don&#8217;t have the time outside of work and other life responsibilities to help. Public transportation, while offering senior discounts, is also out of the question for many.</p><p>Here&#8217;s where you can come in with a new set of wheels. Seniors need reliable transportation services, and a comforting one at that. Such a business would entail you, or drivers you hire, chauffeuring seniors around, waiting for them when running errands or while they go to a medical visit. Make sure you have at least one vehicle that accommodates wheelchair users with lifts and extra seat spacing.</p><h2><strong>Traveling Tech Wizard</strong></h2><p>Now that their grandchildren, and most likely their children themselves, are on the frontline of the technology age, seniors need to learn basics of online communication and tasks in case they want to keep in touch with family and friends in a more convenient way than soup cans and string.</p><p>You can start by publicizing yourself to retirement care facilities around your area and pitching a tech training seminar. If all goes well, they&#8217;ll call back for more so other residents get the chance to check out this newfangled contraption they call &#8220;the interweb.&#8221;</p><p>Some topics you can go over is simple word processor applications like Microsoft Word, the fundamentals to sending, reading and receiving emails, face time, and the <a href=\"http://income.com/90/social-media-a-proven-marketing-initiative-for-entrepreneurs/\" target=\"_blank\">basics of social media</a>for those brave souls who dare venture to wade into the Facebook fray.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> sees a hot market on the horizon for senior living and care businesses. But it&#8217;s likely entrepreneurs like you will clog the industry. In that case, you need to set yourself apart from the others who start the same tired retirement living and healthcare firms. Make a name for yourself by providing transport services or tech training; <a href=\"http://income.com/67/3-keys-for-starting-a-successful-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\">in addition to the money you&#8217;ll make</a>, you might even get a butterscotch candy out of it.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/forum/forum.php\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Community_banner.png\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.mylanderpages.com/income/howtocreateawebsiteebook_4\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-577\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/howtocreateawebsiteebook1.png\" width=\"641\" height=\"123\" /></a></p><p>The post <a href=\"http://income.com/1937/senior-living-and-care-2-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business/\">Senior Living And Care: 2 Ideas For Starting A Small Business</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://income.com\">income.com</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/income/YOKa/~4/6iH5-hPObjo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://income.com/1937/senior-living-and-care-2-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://income.com/1937/senior-living-and-care-2-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business/")) (item nil (title nil "Grow Your Small Business By Exporting") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/income/YOKa/~3/pdViAvltCp0/") (comments nil "http://income.com/1934/grow-your-small-business-by-exporting/#comments") (pubDate nil "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 14:02:07 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Tedd Johnson") (category nil "Articles") (category nil "Entrepreneur Advice") (category nil "Small Business") (guid ((isPermaLink .

All those people are consumers in their own right, too. If you are serious about making your small business all it can be, you need to investigate exporting if you want to tap the growing global market and establish your startup as a true force to be reckoned with.</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> understands that many entrepreneurs, while still in tune with a global perspective, don&#8217;t have much knowledge on the subject of exports, how the logistics work out and which foreign markets are the best. In order to prime your business for exporting, it may help to consider federal assistance and do a little homework on where your products would sell the best.</p><h2><strong>SBA Can Help</strong></h2><p>While it&#8217;s quite clear entrepreneurs like to operate on their own, sometimes looking to external avenues of aid might provide businesses with just the bump they need. In this case, <a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/small-business-matters/small-business-guide-exporting-part-1-getting\" target=\"_blank\">the U.S. Small Business Administration</a> (SBA) is actually a strong partner for entrepreneurs to vet when considering small-business exporting.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-mills/small-business-exporting_b_2814446.html\" target=\"_blank\">In a recent editorial piece</a>, outgoing SBA Administrator Karen Mills detailed the lengths the agency goes to help small businesses prepare and fund exporting operations. Mills said since fiscal year 2009, the SBA has guaranteed some 6,400 loans to entrepreneurial exporters worth more than $3.3 billion supporting $6.3 billion exports. She also noted the agency employs 19 international trade experts at assistance centers and have trained more than 58,000 small businesses in exporting strategies and financing options.</p><p>Registering with <a href=\"http://export.gov/begin/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Export.gov</a> can also give small-business owners access to key resources like trade agreements and market research.</p><h2><strong>Where In The World <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">Is Carmen Sandiego</span> Should You Export To</strong></h2><p>Exporting can be as simple as selling to our neighbors to the north and south &#8211; Canada and Mexico &#8211; or entail a more expansive operation that requires overseas management.</p><p>But before the concept of a globalized small business and the myriad choices owners are pressed with when deciding where to export causes you alarm, consider the story of Orly International, a California-based business that makes nail care products. <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/21/business/la-fi-smallbiz-export-20110221\" target=\"_blank\">As profiled in The Los Angeles Times</a>, Orly&#8217;s foreign sales growth outstripped that of their annual domestic increases. And they&#8217;re doing it by selling all over: The Times reported the 105-employee firm exports to 82 countries.</p><p>&#8220;We just have seen such a growth opportunity in our export business that we have accelerated that emphasis to build more export markets,&#8221; said Bob Hobe, Orly&#8217;s vice president for international business development, told the newspaper.</p><p>To start, it&#8217;s well worth investigating your prospects in emerging economies &#8211; primarily, Brazil, China and India. Together, the population of the three developing economies total some 2.7 million, a sizeable consumer base. These countries are rapidly ascending the economic chain after lying dormant for some time. As such, they are prime areas of expansion for small-business owners with exporting in mind.</p><p>Another route of exporting to consider is selling to old standbys, like Western European markets, and countries on good terms with the United States that have shown a proclivity for buying American-made products. Countries like Australia, the Philippines, South Africa and Japan all come to mind.</p><p>Besides the big three of Brazil, China and India, also keep an eye on other emerging markets that boast a growing middle class and increasing demand for consumer products. Like Latin America countries including Chile and Argentina.</p><h2><strong>Set Up Digital Shop</strong></h2><p>One way entrepreneurs can take exporting duties into their own hands is by creating an<a href=\"http://income.com/1159/tap-into-billions-4-ways-to-strike-gold-with-foreign-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">ecommerce site specifically geared toward foreign customers</a>. You don&#8217;t need to round the Cape Horn anymore to talk to the other side of the Pacific, just hop online. Ecommerce facilitates simplified business-consumer relationships and transaction and allows you to reach an ever-expanding global market from your office chair.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/how-to-build-a-website-a-step-by-step-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\">Online opportunities</a> abound and entrepreneurs need to take advantage of their technological capabilities to compete on a global stage. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/small-business-network/2013/feb/18/online-sales-overseas\" target=\"_blank\">A survey by Freelancer.co.uk</a> or 2,200 small business in the United Kingdom found a year-over-year increase of 36 percent in the number of firms selling products overseas via ecommerce. It also found a 32 percent increase in startups that sell products exclusively online.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> wants entrepreneurs to understand the money-making opportunities available to them outside the United States. In order to tap global markets, you might need some help from government programs, but in the end, it&#8217;s up to you.

Here&#8217;s where your <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">animal</span> entrepreneurial instincts kick in: owners need well-behaving dogs, dogs need training, but owners can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t do it. Right there is your chance to turn your life-long appreciation of animals into a business opportunity. Heck, Cesar Milan even turned it into a TV show!</p><p>First, you&#8217;ll need to get some real-world experience in dog training and <a href=\"http://education-portal.com/articles/How_to_Become_a_Dog_Obedience_Trainer_Step-by-Step_Career_Guide.html\" target=\"_blank\">get certified</a>. There&#8217;s a number of obedience training programs that churn out accredited dog trainers. Then find customers. Why not try posting flyers in a local dog park and using word-of-mouth marketing through friends and family? To boost the customer experience, you can even print out inexpensive diplomas for dog owners to keep.</p><h2><strong>&#8220;Waiter, I want my food right meow!&#8221;</strong></h2><p>Some pets are as picky about the food they eat as the toddlers they sometimes act like. Cats are notorious food snobs and owners will go out of their way to find soft food made of turkey giblets when tuna, chicken or beef just simply won&#8217;t do.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/20/how-to-know-somebody-was-born-to-be-an-entrepreneur/\" target=\"_blank\">If you&#8217;ve got a passion</a> for cooking and experimenting with new recipes, becoming a specialty chef for pet foods may be an opportunity you want to explore. You can market your products as exclusive or even work on a case-by-case basis and charge a premium fee for personalized services. Fancy Feast has got nothing on you. <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/start-pet-treat-business-4409.html\" target=\"_blank\">Another potential avenue for money-making is pet treats</a>, which are a frequent buy for owners that want to keep their pets happy.</p><p>Just remember that nutrition is the overarching focus when making pet foods. Whether you want to create a protein-rich food to market to sporting dog owners or an all-around healthy entree to keep cats lean and mean &#8211; emphasis on the latter &#8211; there are a number of different products to create. Packaging is also a crucial element. People eat foods that look good, and before that, they choose foods with the most aesthetically pleasing packaging. There&#8217;s ample opportunity to create color-popping labels that attract attention, and ultimately, business.</p><h2><strong>All Dogs Go To Heaven</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, like all things we love, cherish and share memories of, we meet a harsh reality when pets die. But there&#8217;s a better way to burying the dead in a mass grave and encountering a Pet Semetary-like experience.</p><p>Cremating pets is a trending business venture and operators are finding that pet owners are willing to pay top money for services.</p><p>&#8220;When people come to the funeral home and I tell them how much it is to cremate their grandfather, it&#8217;s never cheap enough for them,&#8221; Bob Walczyk, owner of a Green Bay pet crematorium, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-07/theres-never-been-a-better-time-to-be-a-dead-pet#p1\" target=\"_blank\">told Bloomberg Businessweek</a>. &#8220;They&#8217;ll say, &#8216;How much? You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me!&#8217; But when the exact same family brings their dog next door, they don&#8217;t even ask about money. They just tell me what they want and they take out their checkbook.&#8221;</p><p>There&#8217;s also an opportunity to resonate on an emotional level with patrons. You can repurpose ashes into a ceramic decoration of sorts that includes an imprint of the pet&#8217;s paw that owners will certainly appreciate as a memento.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.income.com/\">Income.com</a> knows brainstorming ideas for starting a small business can be difficult, but sometimes you need look no farther than the ball of fur cuddled around your ankles. Owners are increasingly spending big money for pet products and services, and you can make money from that by starting up a business that caters to such needs. Be it obedience training, food preparation or crematory services, pet small businesses are worth investigating.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/forum/forum.php\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Community_banner.png\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.mylanderpages.com/income/howtocreateawebsiteebook_4\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-577\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/howtocreateawebsiteebook1.png\" width=\"641\" height=\"123\" /></a></p><p>The post <a href=\"http://income.com/1928/3-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business-in-the-pet-niche/\">3 Ideas For Starting A Small Business In The Pet Niche</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://income.com\">income.com</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/income/YOKa/~4/oGljsEcFe_Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://income.com/1928/3-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business-in-the-pet-niche/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://income.com/1928/3-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business-in-the-pet-niche/")) (item nil (title nil "Small-Business Marketing Help: Are Daily Deals Worth It?")

And for good reason; daily coupons aren&#8217;t actually all they&#8217;re cracked up to be in terms of benefits to the small business. To add to that, the constant state of flux leading companies like Groupon and LivingSocial find themselves in have scared off many.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> warns you to not depend too much on getting small-business marketing help from daily deals. Instead, if you plan on offering customers limited coupons <a href=\"http://income.com/1128/two-cheap-tricks-to-have-your-customers-begging-for-more/\" target=\"_blank\">in order to boost loyalty</a>and business, you&#8217;ll need to investigate some alternative options, including making your own incentivized coupons and working with a provider who&#8217;s more attune to small-business needs.</p><h2><strong>What&#8217;s the difference between Groupon and a sinking ship?</strong></h2><p>Trick question: There is none.</p><p>The latest news about Groupon broke when the company announced it had fired its founder and CEO Andrew Mason. The move was enough to drive up Groupon&#8217;s much-maligned stock shares, but it did little to quell simmering fears and trepidations small-business owners have. Groupon was already floundering in the face of enormous expectations and a change at the top <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-28/firing-andrew-mason-wont-save-groupon#r=hpt-ls\" target=\"_blank\">still isn&#8217;t the fix entrepreneurs were looking for</a>.</p><p>Already, small-business owners have abandoned the marketing medium they had flocked to not long before. <a href=\"http://www.manta.com/media/holiday_survey_10302012\" target=\"_blank\">A Manata survey</a> from late last year found 82 percent of surveyed entrepreneurs didn&#8217;t run a daily deal or opted not to during the buildup to the 2012 holiday shopping season.</p><p>Their main grievances with the daily deal formula? One, small businesses have to pay a fee on top of an already significantly marked-down product or service; and two, the deals did very little to inspire repeat business. In fact, 11 percent of those who ran deals said they lost money or got no boost.</p><p>Groupon&#8217;s main competitor in the daily deal arena hasn&#8217;t fared much better, LivingSocial <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/02/livingsocial-cancels-bonuses-amid.html\" target=\"_blank\">lost $650 million in 2012</a> and continues to tank on financial goals, forcing the company to cancel all performance bonuses.</p><p>So what&#8217;s a small-business owner to do when he or she looks to utilize coupon marketing? Well, the strategies to avoid are obvious, but the ones to try out are less clear, requiring entrepreneurs to put some real thought into how they use coupons for small-business marketing help.</p><h2><strong>Encourage customer loyalty</strong></h2><p>While in theory coupons are huge generators of repeat customers, Groupon&#8217;s daily deals did little to inspire loyalty among users. The root of the problem? Loyal customers didn&#8217;t browse and use coupons to the same degree as deal hunters who were in the market for a one-off purchase where they could save as much as possible.</p><p>In order to counter that approach, you&#8217;ll need to make and distribute coupons that clearly demonstrate to customers that they can enjoy savings by giving their continued business to a firm.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.smallbusinessnewz.com/effective-coupons-and-repeat-business-2008-06\" target=\"_blank\">Take for instance Chris Crum&#8217;s experience</a>. Writing for Small Business Newz, Crum said he had some trouble with his brakes and went to a mechanic. After getting the problem fixed, the mechanic gave him a coupon for 20 percent off the next service. When he had more trouble with his car, he knew where to take it.</p><p>Taking the one-off approach with a daily deal aggregator might lead to a singular boom in business, but it won&#8217;t prove to be a viable strategy for attracting consumers and converting them into long-time customers.</p><h2><strong>Is a Groupon of another name still Groupon?</strong></h2><p>In short, yes and no.</p><p>While <a href=\"http://getprivy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Privy</a> is a deal site that works similar to Groupon &#8211; small-business owners have to go through an outside entity to distribute the deal - Privy works in a way that is more beneficial to small businesses.</p><p>For instance, while Groupon and similar deal aggregators can take up to 50 percent off in transaction fees, Privy only levies a 15 percent fee, founder Benjamin Jabbawy <a href=\"http://www.biztechmagazine.com/article/2012/04/privy-daily-deals-alternative-businesses-control\" target=\"_blank\">told BizTech magazine</a>.</p><p>Privy works by having small-business owners customize their own deal, either a loyalty promotion or an acquisition initiative, which Privy then distributes through email and a variety of<a href=\"http://income.com/90/social-media-a-proven-marketing-initiative-for-entrepreneurs/\" target=\"_blank\">social media channels</a>. This allows you to collect addresses of coupon redeemers and keep tabs on how the campaign fared.</p><p>&#8220;Privy flips the model and puts the business in the driver&#8217;s seat,&#8221; the BizTech article reads. &#8220;It lets businesses offer daily deals on their <a href=\"http://income.com/how-to-build-a-website-a-step-by-step-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\">websites</a> or Facebook page at their own price and pace. Business owners set the terms of how much of a discount the deal will offer, how long it will last, and how it can be redeemed.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> wants entrepreneurs to know coupon marketing as a whole is not dead, but the daily deal model sure is. You&#8217;re better off ditching Groupon and LivingSocial while you can and instead focusing on your own coupons or working with a startup specifically catering to small businesses&#8217; coupon needs. Just remember, fostering customer loyalty should be the main objective and large-scale aggregators do little to inspire such confidence in businesses and consumers alike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/forum/forum.php\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Community_banner.png\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.mylanderpages.com/income/howtocreateawebsiteebook_4\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-577\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/howtocreateawebsiteebook1.png\" width=\"641\" height=\"123\" /></a></p><p>The post <a href=\"http://income.com/1924/small-business-marketing-help-are-daily-deals-worth-it/\">Small-Business Marketing Help: Are Daily Deals Worth It?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://income.com\">income.com</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/income/YOKa/~4/iQ-2tGVP4RM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://income.com/1924/small-business-marketing-help-are-daily-deals-worth-it/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://income.com/1924/small-business-marketing-help-are-daily-deals-worth-it/")) (item nil (title nil "Real Ways to Make Money Online from Odds and Ends") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/income/YOKa/~3/lsE5QpLI5i0/") (comments nil "http://income.com/1901/real-ways-to-make-money-online-from-odds-and-ends/#comments") (pubDate nil "Tue, 12 Mar 2013 14:06:31 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Tedd Johnson") (category nil "Articles") (category nil "Making Money Online From Home") (category nil "Small Business") (guid ((isPermaLink .

As such, small businesses need to address consumer concerns on social media in a prompt and orderly fashion just as they would with these more dated channels.</p><p>Respond to users that tweet at you with a question and talk with others who may message you because they had an unsatisfactory experience.</p><p>Using social media isn&#8217;t just a way to resolve disputes; <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2013/02/28/12-more-ways-to-be-legendary-and-successful-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\">engagement can also lead to improved perception</a>. Liking Facebook comments and showcasing user-submitted content or positive feedback all lead to creating a welcoming online persona.</p><h2><strong>Never pass up an opportunity to advance the brand</strong></h2><p>The increasing emphasis placed on visual elements in social media are specifically designed to help small-business owners build brand appeal. There are several opportunities to build brand recognition and value: Facebook and Twitter cover photos, Pinterest image threads and the different styles of visual content shared on Tumblr are just a couple of the avenues afforded to social media-using entrepreneurs to boost the brand.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> holds that more often than not, <a href=\"http://income.com/67/3-keys-for-starting-a-successful-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\">you&#8217;ll only succeed when you have definite goals</a> in mind; that goes for both the business overall and social media. You can&#8217;t use social media willy-nilly and expect tangible results that end up with you making more money. Sell your products online? Use social media to drive web traffic. Want to retain clients and keep them happy? Engage them in online networks. Want to improve your business&#8217; cultural appeal? Social media branding is the best technique.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/forum/forum.php\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Community_banner.png\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.mylanderpages.com/income/howtocreateawebsiteebook_4\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-577\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/howtocreateawebsiteebook1.png\" width=\"641\" height=\"123\" /></a></p><p>The post <a href=\"http://income.com/1896/what-social-media-use-accomplishes-for-small-businesses/\">What Social Media Use Accomplishes For Small Businesses</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://income.com\">income.com</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/income/YOKa/~4/s1uKIRWobS4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://income.com/1896/what-social-media-use-accomplishes-for-small-businesses/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://income.com/1896/what-social-media-use-accomplishes-for-small-businesses/")) (item nil (title nil "How To Start A Consulting Business") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/income/YOKa/~3/HF7pCO1RAH8/") (comments nil "http://income.com/1892/how-to-start-a-consulting-business/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sun, 10 Mar 2013 17:47:50 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Tedd Johnson") (category nil "Articles") (category nil "Ideas For Starting A Small Business") (category nil "Small Business") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Have a steel-trap of a mind that&#8217;s chock full with inventive and innovative business ideas? Don&#8217;t know how to parlay that intellectual richness into real world riches? There&#8217;s a simple answer to that dilemma: <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com/starting-a-business/2011/11/03/five-tips-on-how-to-start-consulting-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Start a small-business consulting service</a>.</p><p>There are scores of aspiring entrepreneurs out there just like you, only some don&#8217;t possess the know-how or ingenuity that accomplished small-business owners build up through their careers.</p><p>Time to put that knowledge to use and earn some good money while you&#8217;re at it. You&#8217;re going to need to pin down your specialty area, network to create a list of contacts and develop a powerhouse online presence.</p><h2><strong>Choose your consulting discipline</strong></h2><p>The best thing about being an entrepreneur is you&#8217;re involved in just about every aspect of business operations. As such, you start to develop an expertise in a number of fields that you can then translate into consulting knowledge.</p><p>There are any number of services an entrepreneur will seek advice from consultants on: accounting, auditing, marketing, sales, increasing revenue, taxes, talent management, expansion, communications, technology, general counseling, mentorship.</p><h2><strong>Network, network and network some more</strong></h2><p>The key to becoming a successful consultant lies in the ability for you to tap an unending list of clients. Rolodexes may have fallen by the wayside, but the notion of having a database of contacts to crawl is still supremely important to consulting.</p><p>Reach out to people you&#8217;ve been in business with before: firms you&#8217;ve collaborated with, suppliers, even competitors. <a href=\"http://income.com/90/social-media-a-proven-marketing-initiative-for-entrepreneurs/\" target=\"_blank\">Social media is also key</a>, it&#8217;s the 21st century forum for business networking. Create a LinkedIn profile and expand from there. Establishing and nurturing business relationships is crucial, entrepreneurs will look to you as a partner and confidant and you need to be prepared for that.</p><h2><strong>Online or bust</strong></h2><p><a href=\"http://income.com/the-small-business-internet-startup-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\">Build a small-business website</a> for your consulting service as soon as you can. Contrary to other common small-business uses, your website won&#8217;t really serve an ecommerce function, but will still act as a central hub to your operations.</p><p>Have an in-house platform for online communication so prospective clients can easily reach you. Make sure to incorporate your social media accounts, as well. Another important element is testimonials. After working with businesses, solicit them to provide a reference or testimonial. Many will often be glad to help you as you helped them.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> knows you can put those entrepreneurial skills to use, it&#8217;s only a matter of finding your consulting niche.

First you&#8217;ll have to decide which kind of landscaping business you want to start, then, you&#8217;ll need to spread the word and arm your business and employees with the right equipment.</p><h2><strong>Several options to choose from</strong></h2><p>Landscaping seems like a pretty straightforward category of business, but there&#8217;s a lot room for innovation below the surface. Not every startup has to be the standard, mow-your-lawn and rake-your-leaves style of operation.</p><p>There&#8217;s a variety of different options when considering which avenue to take. You can start a sod installation and hydroseeding firm, or you could go the weeding and pest control route. Tree care and maintenance is always a good option, as are specialty lawn care contracting opportunities. Hell, you can even mirror Eddie Scissorhands and start your own topiary small business.</p><p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind what local competition your business would have and what the consumer demand is. If you&#8217;re in a community that&#8217;s active in gardening but lacking in its lawn fertilizer treatments, that&#8217;ll clue you in on the next path of action.</p><h2><strong>It&#8217;s not a child&#8217;s game</strong></h2><p>While any 11-year-old can mow the lawn, that kind of quality and work ethic won&#8217;t fly with clients expecting professional services. You and any employees you might have will need to brush up on the best practices for lawn trimming, thorn bush pruning and even leaf raking.</p><p>Once you feel you&#8217;ve mastered the art, apply for local certification so you can assure potential customers that you&#8217;re the real deal.</p><h2><strong>Canvas the area</strong></h2><p>To start, you&#8217;ll need to build up a local following before you can expand to outlying areas. Make some flyers and take a ride around town looking for homes with seemingly unkempt lawns and yards, they&#8217;ll be your perfect clients to start with.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/90/social-media-a-proven-marketing-initiative-for-entrepreneurs/\" target=\"_blank\">Get active on social media as well</a>. Images are becoming increasingly important to social connection, and what better image to post or pin than a scenic, pastoral snapshot of some of your best work.</p><h2><strong>Write off equipment</strong></h2><p>Landscaping businesses require a lot of equipment: lawn mowers, rakes, shears, gloves, protective eyewear, transportation. But don&#8217;t fret, you can write off big equipment purchases like mowers and trucks under the Section 179 deduction, which under the current parameters, allows for up to $500,000 in deductions on no more than $2 million in purchases for 2013.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> knows successful <a href=\"http://income.com/67/3-keys-for-starting-a-successful-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneurs are all about the green</a> - in this case, both in reference to grass and money. <a href=\"http://www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=61783\" target=\"_blank\">Landscaping small businesses</a> are an evergreen option for making money and you can certainly hedge your bets that a lawn care startup will pay off.

So to make sure your PPC campaign is successful, there are a couple things to keep in mind like making sure you have custom landing pages and not having enough of a specific focus in your ads.</p><h2><strong>Do not depend on Google</strong></h2><p>Using Google AdWords is the simplest way to running a PPC campaign for small-business owners unfamiliar to the channel. However, be aware that there are alternatives to Google, which may not prove to be the most effective platform for some owners. Consider breaking the Google chain and investigate using Yahoo, Bing or Amazon.</p><p>Sometimes big-name players just don&#8217;t fit your needs. In that case, consider smaller platforms like Clicksor or Chikita that provide the same services but are more attune to small-business needs.</p><h2><strong>Do have custom landing pages</strong></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.startupnation.com/business-articles/9857/1/cardinal-sin-of-ppc-advertising.htm\" target=\"_blank\">No PPC campaign is complete without custom landing pages</a>. The key to meaningful conversions is sending clickers to targeted pages that relate to the ad they clicked on. Users that are sent to home pages, shopping carts and online registration forms are unlikely to be happy with their experience and end up costing you money.</p><p>A custom landing page is a page specifically designed to work with your PPC campaign. It has to connect with what the ad purports; if you&#8217;re advertising about children&#8217;s toys, your landing page better direct the user to a specific product&#8217;s page, and not your &#8220;About Us.&#8221;</p><p>Landing pages should have distinct calls to action, a clean layout and testimonials that lend credence to your offering.</p><h2><strong>Do not ignore geographic targeting</strong></h2><p>The main draw of internet marketing is the ability for small-business owners to hyperlocalize or target their advertising efforts to reach and resonate with local customers. Optimizing for keywords that relate directly to your geographic location and that of your consumer base is hugely important to a successful PPC campaign.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> knows entrepreneurs are turning to online marketing methods in droves because of the expanded reach and cost savings that are afforded to them. However, it urges entrepreneurs to not dive straight into PPC <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/run-ppc-campaign-120009351.html\" target=\"_blank\">without a basic understanding</a> of the right and wrong ways to run a campaign. Just remember, there are alternatives to Google that can suffice. And don&#8217;t forget: Geo-targeting is a must for any campaign and custom landing pages will net you profitable conversions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/forum/forum.php\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Community_banner.png\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.mylanderpages.com/income/howtocreateawebsiteebook_4\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-577\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/howtocreateawebsiteebook1.png\" width=\"641\" height=\"123\" /></a></p><p>The post <a href=\"http://income.com/1884/small-business-marketing-help-how-to-and-how-not-to-run-a-ppc-campaign/\">Small-Business Marketing Help: How To &#8211; And How Not To &#8211; Run A PPC Campaign</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://income.com\">income.com</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/income/YOKa/~4/oEcCJmUbtjA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://income.com/1884/small-business-marketing-help-how-to-and-how-not-to-run-a-ppc-campaign/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://income.com/1884/small-business-marketing-help-how-to-and-how-not-to-run-a-ppc-campaign/")))) ("How To Run Your Own Small-Business Brewery" "<div id=\"attachment_1943\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" style=\"width: 301px\"><a href=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/x_0_0_0_14074013_300.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1943\" alt=\"Microbrewery startups are making more entrepreneurs drunk off success.\" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/x_0_0_0_14074013_300.jpg\" width=\"291\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Microbrewery startups are making more entrepreneurs drunk off success.</p></div><p>Many a time, people will look for a little liquid inspiration when trying to run up the nerve to approach someone at the bar or sit through Thanksgiving dinner.</p><p>However, the ambrosial nectar of the gods is good for more than just rallying courage – it could prove to be your next best idea for starting a small business.</p><p>From happy hour on Tuesday to Thirsty Thursdays and Sunday afternoons when the game is on, kicking back with a cold brew is a favorite pastime across the country. That being said, there’s a huge consumer market for beer in the country, supplying a demand that is unlikely to ever be quenched.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> wants brewski-brewing business owners to know they can succeed even with the presence of high-profile competitors like Miller and Budweiser. Local beers are about a trendy as local eats and increasingly, entrepreneurs are seeing opening their own brewery as a route to<a href=\"http://income.com/67/3-keys-for-starting-a-successful-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\">small-business success</a>.</p><p>However, entrepreneurs should know starting a micro-brewery can be a very different process compared to what some serial entrepreneurs may be accustomed to. You’ll need to develop industry knowledge, keep regulatory compliance a top priority and make inroads in the local market.</p><p>Do it right and soon enough consumers be foaming at the mouth for your suds.</p><h2><strong>Beer Love Doesn’t Always Translate To Knowledge</strong></h2><p>Every drinker on the planet fashions him or herself out to be a connoisseur on all things beer. However, unless you know the difference between Galena hops and Glacier hops, your monkey chug record won’t prove to be of much assistance in preparing operations. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zM5P5iOKzI\" target=\"_blank\">Nobody wants to end up like this guy</a>.</p><p>There’s a lot of education and street smarts that go into crafting the right brew, things that can only be picked up through practice and experience. Owners often have to brew a number of batches before they can get their recipe for a Belgian white ale down pat. Brewing as a hobby helps, but oftentimes, entrepreneurs are mostly involved in the day-to-day operations of running a startup. You might need to bring on an expert brewer for some help in getting things stirring.</p><p>But don’t let that discourage you. Take for instance the case of Curt Cameron, <a href=\"http://www.hartfordbusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130107/PRINTEDITION/301049982\" target=\"_blank\">a serial entrepreneur who bought and runs his own brewery</a>. In a profile piece printed in The Hartford Business Journal, Cameron said he had previously <a href=\"http://income.com/1887/green-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business-landscaping/\" target=\"_blank\">run a landscaping business</a>, even owned liquor stores, but had no brewing skills or experience on his resume. However, that didn’t stop him netting an estimated $2 million in 2012, six years after he bought his brewery and transformed it into a local fixture.</p><h2><strong>Laws, Regulations Vary By State</strong></h2><p>While an all-beer diet might not be the most healthy option, beer is in essence, food. And as such, it is a stringently regulated commodity for consumption, making regulatory compliance a top-of-mind issue for startup breweries.

That being said, there&#8217;s a huge consumer market for beer in the country, supplying a demand that is unlikely to ever be quenched.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> wants brewski-brewing business owners to know they can succeed even with the presence of high-profile competitors like Miller and Budweiser. Local beers are about a trendy as local eats and increasingly, entrepreneurs are seeing opening their own brewery as a route to<a href=\"http://income.com/67/3-keys-for-starting-a-successful-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\">small-business success</a>.</p><p>However, entrepreneurs should know starting a micro-brewery can be a very different process compared to what some serial entrepreneurs may be accustomed to. You&#8217;ll need to develop industry knowledge, keep regulatory compliance a top priority and make inroads in the local market.</p><p>Do it right and soon enough consumers be foaming at the mouth for your suds.</p><h2><strong>Beer Love Doesn&#8217;t Always Translate To Knowledge</strong></h2><p>Every drinker on the planet fashions him or herself out to be a connoisseur on all things beer. However, unless you know the difference between Galena hops and Glacier hops, your monkey chug record won&#8217;t prove to be of much assistance in preparing operations. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zM5P5iOKzI\" target=\"_blank\">Nobody wants to end up like this guy</a>.</p><p>There&#8217;s a lot of education and street smarts that go into crafting the right brew, things that can only be picked up through practice and experience. Owners often have to brew a number of batches before they can get their recipe for a Belgian white ale down pat. Brewing as a hobby helps, but oftentimes, entrepreneurs are mostly involved in the day-to-day operations of running a startup. You might need to bring on an expert brewer for some help in getting things stirring.</p><p>But don&#8217;t let that discourage you. Take for instance the case of Curt Cameron, <a href=\"http://www.hartfordbusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130107/PRINTEDITION/301049982\" target=\"_blank\">a serial entrepreneur who bought and runs his own brewery</a>. In a profile piece printed in The Hartford Business Journal, Cameron said he had previously <a href=\"http://income.com/1887/green-ideas-for-starting-a-small-business-landscaping/\" target=\"_blank\">run a landscaping business</a>, even owned liquor stores, but had no brewing skills or experience on his resume. However, that didn&#8217;t stop him netting an estimated $2 million in 2012, six years after he bought his brewery and transformed it into a local fixture.</p><h2><strong>Laws, Regulations Vary By State</strong></h2><p>While an all-beer diet might not be the most healthy option, beer is in essence, food. And as such, it is a stringently regulated commodity for consumption, making regulatory compliance a top-of-mind issue for startup breweries. Making matters somewhat more complicated for entrepreneurs are the <a href=\"http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/government-affairs/self-distribution-laws\" target=\"_blank\">varying levels and language of brewery regulations found across states</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/start-minibrewery-12964.html\" target=\"_blank\">As suggested by The Houston Chronicle</a>, it&#8217;s imperative you know what laws and regulations your state keeps in regard to production and distribution of alcohol.

All those people are consumers in their own right, too. If you are serious about making your small business all it can be, you need to investigate exporting if you want to tap the growing global market and establish your startup as a true force to be reckoned with.</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> understands that many entrepreneurs, while still in tune with a global perspective, don’t have much knowledge on the subject of exports, how the logistics work out and which foreign markets are the best. In order to prime your business for exporting, it may help to consider federal assistance and do a little homework on where your products would sell the best.</p><h2><strong>SBA Can Help</strong></h2><p>While it’s quite clear entrepreneurs like to operate on their own, sometimes looking to external avenues of aid might provide businesses with just the bump they need. In this case, <a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/small-business-matters/small-business-guide-exporting-part-1-getting\" target=\"_blank\">the U.S. Small Business Administration</a> (SBA) is actually a strong partner for entrepreneurs to vet when considering small-business exporting.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-mills/small-business-exporting_b_2814446.html\" target=\"_blank\">In a recent editorial piece</a>, outgoing SBA Administrator Karen Mills detailed the lengths the agency goes to help small businesses prepare and fund exporting operations. Mills said since fiscal year 2009, the SBA has guaranteed some 6,400 loans to entrepreneurial exporters worth more than $3.3 billion supporting $6.3 billion exports. She also noted the agency employs 19 international trade experts at assistance centers and have trained more than 58,000 small businesses in exporting strategies and financing options.</p><p>Registering with <a href=\"http://export.gov/begin/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Export.gov</a> can also give small-business owners access to key resources like trade agreements and market research.</p><h2><strong>Where In The World <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">Is Carmen Sandiego</span> Should You Export To</strong></h2><p>Exporting can be as simple as selling to our neighbors to the north and south – Canada and Mexico – or entail a more expansive operation that requires overseas management.</p><p>But before the concept of a globalized small business and the myriad choices owners are pressed with when deciding where to export causes you alarm, consider the story of Orly International, a California-based business that makes nail care products. <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/21/business/la-fi-smallbiz-export-20110221\" target=\"_blank\">As profiled in The Los Angeles Times</a>, Orly’s foreign sales growth outstripped that of their annual domestic increases. And they’re doing it by selling all over: The Times reported the 105-employee firm exports to 82 countries.</p><p>“We just have seen such a growth opportunity in our export business that we have accelerated that emphasis to build more export markets,” said Bob Hobe, Orly’s vice president for international business development, told the newspaper.</p><p>To start, it’s well worth investigating your prospects in emerging economies – primarily, Brazil, China and India. Together, the population of the three developing economies total some 2.7 million, a sizeable consumer base. These countries are rapidly ascending the economic chain after lying dormant for some time.

All those people are consumers in their own right, too. If you are serious about making your small business all it can be, you need to investigate exporting if you want to tap the growing global market and establish your startup as a true force to be reckoned with.</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> understands that many entrepreneurs, while still in tune with a global perspective, don&#8217;t have much knowledge on the subject of exports, how the logistics work out and which foreign markets are the best. In order to prime your business for exporting, it may help to consider federal assistance and do a little homework on where your products would sell the best.</p><h2><strong>SBA Can Help</strong></h2><p>While it&#8217;s quite clear entrepreneurs like to operate on their own, sometimes looking to external avenues of aid might provide businesses with just the bump they need. In this case, <a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/small-business-matters/small-business-guide-exporting-part-1-getting\" target=\"_blank\">the U.S. Small Business Administration</a> (SBA) is actually a strong partner for entrepreneurs to vet when considering small-business exporting.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-mills/small-business-exporting_b_2814446.html\" target=\"_blank\">In a recent editorial piece</a>, outgoing SBA Administrator Karen Mills detailed the lengths the agency goes to help small businesses prepare and fund exporting operations. Mills said since fiscal year 2009, the SBA has guaranteed some 6,400 loans to entrepreneurial exporters worth more than $3.3 billion supporting $6.3 billion exports. She also noted the agency employs 19 international trade experts at assistance centers and have trained more than 58,000 small businesses in exporting strategies and financing options.</p><p>Registering with <a href=\"http://export.gov/begin/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Export.gov</a> can also give small-business owners access to key resources like trade agreements and market research.</p><h2><strong>Where In The World <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">Is Carmen Sandiego</span> Should You Export To</strong></h2><p>Exporting can be as simple as selling to our neighbors to the north and south &#8211; Canada and Mexico &#8211; or entail a more expansive operation that requires overseas management.</p><p>But before the concept of a globalized small business and the myriad choices owners are pressed with when deciding where to export causes you alarm, consider the story of Orly International, a California-based business that makes nail care products. <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/21/business/la-fi-smallbiz-export-20110221\" target=\"_blank\">As profiled in The Los Angeles Times</a>, Orly&#8217;s foreign sales growth outstripped that of their annual domestic increases. And they&#8217;re doing it by selling all over: The Times reported the 105-employee firm exports to 82 countries.</p><p>&#8220;We just have seen such a growth opportunity in our export business that we have accelerated that emphasis to build more export markets,&#8221; said Bob Hobe, Orly&#8217;s vice president for international business development, told the newspaper.</p><p>To start, it&#8217;s well worth investigating your prospects in emerging economies &#8211; primarily, Brazil, China and India. Together, the population of the three developing economies total some 2.7 million, a sizeable consumer base. These countries are rapidly ascending the economic chain after lying dormant for some time. As such, they are prime areas of expansion for small-business owners with exporting in mind.</p><p>Another route of exporting to consider is selling to old standbys, like Western European markets, and countries on good terms with the United States that have shown a proclivity for buying American-made products.

We have apps to start our cars, dim the lights at home while we’re away and even translator apps that you can speak directly into and hear fluent Italian come out of.</p><p>That’s some pretty sophisticated technology, so how does it make its way to the market with full confidence from the publisher? By getting tested by real-life users.</p><p>So, if you’re a tech-geek and you’ve got some downtime to try out some up-and-coming apps, you might as well earn some money while doing so.</p><p>How, you ask? <a href=\"http://www.wahadventures.com/2011/08/utest-com-earn-money-testing-software.html\" target=\"_blank\">By signing up on uTest</a>, the world’s largest software testing community with more than 70,000 testers spread across 190 countries. By signing up with uTest, you can become a paid tester for mobile and desktops apps. After filling out your profile, uTest will send out test invites matched to your profile and you’ll get to trial software to find bugs. Testers are paid twice a month for approved reports the file.</p><h2><strong>Snapshots pay off</strong></h2><p>In the age of Instagram, everyone fashions themselves to be a master photographer. Take a picture of a sidewalk crack, throw in a sepia filter for good measure and voilà – Louis Daguerre who?</p><p>Turns out, you actually can be a professional photographer and get paid for all the quick pics you take in a day even if it’s not your actual business. Stock photo databases like Thinkstock, iStockphoto, Shutterstock and Dreamstime are always in the market to build their ever-increasing caches of animals in doctor coats and businesspeople on computers.</p><p>But believe it or not, it’s a lucrative business; Yuri Arcurs, the <a href=\"http://arcurs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">self-proclaimed world’s top-selling stock photographer</a>, sells a picture every eight seconds! Stock photos get a hilarious reputation for being outlandish or flat out bad, but the fact is databases will pay for your photos, and more often than not, someone will find a use for them.</p><h2><strong>Arts and crafts time for adults</strong></h2><p>If you’ve got some artistic flair or <a href=\"http://income.com/1623/how-my-kid-brother-turned-passion-into-profit/\" target=\"_blank\">just have a passion</a> for being creative, you’ll never have to rue the day you pursued a major in art history again if you get online and start selling on the internet.</p><p>If you make jewelry, design home decorations, knit sweaters or even make specialty tags for dog collars, you better take advantage of the opportunities afforded to you by ecommerce marketplaces like Etsy, which has developed a massive following and carved out a niche space online for its vintage and homemade product sellers and buyers. ArtFire is another great online shopping hub for artisans to peddle their wares.</p><p>Such ecommerce sites are a better bet than large-scale marketplaces like eBay or Amazon for some entrepreneurs, as they can attract a more dedicated following and benefit from a specialized atmosphere that allows you to market your products the way you want to.</p><h2><strong>Typewriters are dead. Long live typing writers!</strong></h2><p>Being an author has historically been an underpaid and underappreciated profession, but the culture of e-books has revolutionized the way underground writers can make money off online books.</p><p>The rapid proliferation of reading devices like Amazon’s Kindle and the iPad have enabled consumers to gather their own digital libraries, and they’re gobbling up all the e-books they can. You won’t need a 1,000-page masterpiece to become an accomplished author in contemporary literature. Fantasy novels have caught like wildfire, thanks to George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones, and romance novels have found new life in the online arena, driven in part by the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, which is routinely a top-seller online.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> wants to remind entrepreneurs that <a href=\"http://income.com/67/3-keys-for-starting-a-successful-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\">real ways to make money online</a> don’t just begin and end with small-business websites.

Take a picture of a sidewalk crack, throw in a sepia filter for good measure and voilà &#8211; Louis Daguerre who?</p><p>Turns out, you actually can be a professional photographer and get paid for all the quick pics you take in a day even if it&#8217;s not your actual business. Stock photo databases like Thinkstock, iStockphoto, Shutterstock and Dreamstime are always in the market to build their ever-increasing caches of animals in doctor coats and businesspeople on computers.</p><p>But believe it or not, it&#8217;s a lucrative business; Yuri Arcurs, the <a href=\"http://arcurs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">self-proclaimed world&#8217;s top-selling stock photographer</a>, sells a picture every eight seconds! Stock photos get a hilarious reputation for being outlandish or flat out bad, but the fact is databases will pay for your photos, and more often than not, someone will find a use for them.</p><h2><strong>Arts and crafts time for adults</strong></h2><p>If you&#8217;ve got some artistic flair or <a href=\"http://income.com/1623/how-my-kid-brother-turned-passion-into-profit/\" target=\"_blank\">just have a passion</a> for being creative, you&#8217;ll never have to rue the day you pursued a major in art history again if you get online and start selling on the internet.</p><p>If you make jewelry, design home decorations, knit sweaters or even make specialty tags for dog collars, you better take advantage of the opportunities afforded to you by ecommerce marketplaces like Etsy, which has developed a massive following and carved out a niche space online for its vintage and homemade product sellers and buyers. ArtFire is another great online shopping hub for artisans to peddle their wares.</p><p>Such ecommerce sites are a better bet than large-scale marketplaces like eBay or Amazon for some entrepreneurs, as they can attract a more dedicated following and benefit from a specialized atmosphere that allows you to market your products the way you want to.</p><h2><strong>Typewriters are dead. Long live typing writers!</strong></h2><p>Being an author has historically been an underpaid and underappreciated profession, but the culture of e-books has revolutionized the way underground writers can make money off online books.</p><p>The rapid proliferation of reading devices like Amazon&#8217;s Kindle and the iPad have enabled consumers to gather their own digital libraries, and they&#8217;re gobbling up all the e-books they can. You won&#8217;t need a 1,000-page masterpiece to become an accomplished author in contemporary literature. Fantasy novels have caught like wildfire, thanks to George R.R. Martin&#8217;s Game of Thrones, and romance novels have found new life in the online arena, driven in part by the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, which is routinely a top-seller online.</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/\">Income.com</a> wants to remind entrepreneurs that <a href=\"http://income.com/67/3-keys-for-starting-a-successful-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\">real ways to make money online</a> don&#8217;t just begin and end with small-business websites. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re good at, you can profit from it by taking your talents to south beach online. Test software, write a book, take a photo or knit some kitten mittens; whatever you do, you can make money online if you find the right channel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://income.com/forum/forum.php\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Community_banner.png\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.mylanderpages.com/income/howtocreateawebsiteebook_4\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-577\" title=\"ebook-banner\" alt=\" \" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/howtocreateawebsiteebook1.png\" width=\"641\" height=\"123\" /></a></p><p>The post <a href=\"http://income.com/1901/real-ways-to-make-money-online-from-odds-and-ends/\">Real Ways to Make Money Online from Odds and Ends</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://income.com\">income.com</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/income/YOKa/~4/lsE5QpLI5i0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://income.com/1901/real-ways-to-make-money-online-from-odds-and-ends/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://income.com/1901/real-ways-to-make-money-online-from-odds-and-ends/"))) ("What Social Media Use Accomplishes For Small Businesses" "<div id=\"attachment_1897\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/x_0_0_0_14073960_300.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1897\" alt=\"You have to know what you want to accomplish by using social media marketing before you can benefit from it.\" src=\"http://income.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/x_0_0_0_14073960_300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"283\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">You have to know what you want to accomplish by using social media marketing before you can benefit from it.</p></div><p>Entrepreneurs once relegated social media to the realm of a passing teenage fad.</p><p>“Twitter me!
