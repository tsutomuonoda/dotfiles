<br />
Today we <a href=\"http://chrome.blogspot.com/2013/03/bringing-chromebooks-to-new-frontiers.html\">announced</a> that Chromebooks are now available in six more countries around the world. Hand-in-hand with several reseller partners, we’ve worked so that you can also purchase Chromebooks for businesses and schools in these same countries.

More than 2,000 schools are now using Chromebooks for Education. Chromebooks help educators improve teaching and learning, whether it’s in one classroom like <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B__OTXR_u3RbclVVcUE2R0tjbUk/edit\">Mr. Hathorn’s History Class in Vermont</a> or for 17,000 students in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B__OTXR_u3RbZHl0Y3dtdVpwLWs/edit\">an entire school district in Richland Two, South Carolina</a>.  To start your school’s journey you can tune into one of the Hangouts On Air next week on <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+GoogleinEducation/posts\">the Google in Education Google+ Page</a>.  During these Hangouts we’ll provide more information about Chromebooks for Education and will answer audience questions.<br />

<br />
Businesses around the world are also using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/devices/\">Chromebooks</a> where they need greater security and increased shareability. For example, Chromebooks enable employees like those on retail shop floors, manufacturing lines and out in the field, giving them access to central information and providing more timely updates on remote conditions. This is helping businesses to make better decisions faster. 
<br />

<i><b>Editor's note:</b> From the founding of Faneuil Hall in 1740 to the opening of Franklin Southie in 2008, Boston’s businesses have embodied an enterprising and entrepreneurial spirit. When we looked at several recent lists of the top startups in the Boston area - from <a href=\"http://bostinno.com/2012/12/20/a-look-at-boston-startups-that-raised-money-in-2012/#ss__276660_1_1__ss\">Bostinno</a>, <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Startups-in-Boston/What-are-the-most-notable-IT-tech-startups-in-Boston\">Quora</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/startups/2013/02/boston-financial-tech-startups-to-watch.html\">Boston Business Journal</a> - we were pleased to discover that about 75% of these companies are running on Apps.&nbsp;</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>Today, we’re wicked excited to hear from Mike Volpe, CMO of <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot</a>, the industry leader in inbound marketing software and one of those top startups. See what other organizations that have gone Google <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/customers.html#utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=en-na-us-entblog-Hubspot031813&amp;utm_campaign=en_us\">have to say</a>.</i>

Back in 2006, two MIT alumni decided there had to be a better way to do marketing. Dharmesh Shah and Brian Halligan knew that loud, interruptive and unwanted advertising wasn’t the way to help businesses attract customers, not to mention that new technology like caller ID and spam filters was simultaneously rendering those legacy efforts less effective. So they started HubSpot, and with it, a new paradigm that would be better for both marketers and customers, replacing loud, interruptive advertising with marketing consumers actually love. 
<br />
<br />
HubSpot has grown to 450 employees since launching in 2006, and along the way, we've settled on a core mantra when it comes to how we work: “use good judgment.” We don’t tell employees where they have to work or when they have to be here - we care most about results. It’s imperative, then, that we leverage enterprise tools that make work easy and accessible anytime and anywhere. That’s why we use Google Apps. It lets us work together whether we’re at our desks or halfway around the world. That, combined with the fact that it grows with us and is simple to use, makes it the perfect solution for our company.
<br />
<br />
Our employees use Google Apps every day on nearly every aspect of our business. With Docs, Sheets and Slides, we’re able to collaborate on our most important documents with our colleagues, no matter where we are. We can store all our files in one place with Drive, so each team knows they can find their templates and notes whether they’re sitting down with their laptops or traveling with their smartphones. And Google Forms makes tracking executive speaking requests simple and seamless. Any time an organization wants a HubSpot expert to talk at an event, we send them a form with a set of standard questions, and the information they submit about the opportunity is automatically populated into a spreadsheet that houses all other requests. It's perfectly efficient.
<br />
<br />
Google Calendar helps us stay transparent, which we consider essential to empowering our employees. Many of our executives book office hours on Google Calendar and share them with our company. Any employee at any level can sign up for an hour with them, where they can bring up anything from product development ideas to problems they’re having at work.
<br />
<br />
Working for a fast-moving company isn’t easy, but with Google Apps, we’re not burdened by the hassles that can otherwise grind busy days to a halt without a strong technology platform. We don’t have to deal with attachments, version history screwups, email outages or fussing around with our phones to get our email to sync. We open up Google Apps and it works. It’s the same experience we offer with our software – simple, effective and lovable.</div>

Prisma Media is a French magazine publisher with approximately 20 titles in subjects such as photography, art and travel. From how to take the best photos to how to properly cook a souffle, our titles, including National Geographic, Female Current and Current Kitchen, have been informing and entertaining readers for years. 
<br />
<br />
As Director of Information Systems at Prisma Media, it’s my job to keep a finger on the pulse of how our employees are using technology. Just as the publishing industry has had sweeping changes the past few years, so too has the way our employees use technology. Last year, I discovered a few enterprising employees who were forgoing our hosted corporate email system in favor of Gmail. They had reached the limit of their email storage and needed a way to stay productive.
<br />
<br />
Traditionally, bringing outside, unsupported technology into the workplace is fraught with concerns around security, lack of manageability and control. Other companies might have quickly revoked access to Gmail for the employees in question and reminded them of the standard company policy when it comes to using unsupported technology at work. Instead, we chose to look at this as an opportunity and reevaluated our technology environment.
<br />
<br />
We decided to go with Google Apps for Business for a number of reasons. First, Apps requires much less support than our previous solution. Simply by going Google, we cut our IT support calls by approximately 30 percent, which saved us money and freed up our IT department for other tasks. The second reason was cost. By switching to Google we cut our email costs by approximately one-third, which is a lot, especially when you consider we’re getting access to a much better, more modern product. Lastly, the switch itself was seamless. By working with Google Apps Reseller GPartner, we were able to continue to manage and run our business without missing a beat, while GPartner handled the switch in approximately 45 days.

Google Apps gives us a more modern, robust and flexible platform at a third of the cost and frees up our tech support resources. It also allows us to do what’s most important: focus on our business. The only drawback is I wish we would have made the move sooner.</div><div class=\"feedflare\">

<br />
Simple data analytics can sometimes seem like a misnomer. Technology that’s simple for engineers and IT may add complexity to business processes. And the inverse can be true for implementing agile analytics into traditional Business Intelligence (BI) systems. We often hear from customers in industries--ranging from retail to hospitality--that highly skilled teams struggle to deliver what the organization really needs: actionable and data-driven business insights.<br />
<br />
Today we’ve added some new capabilities to <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/big-query\">Google BigQuery</a> that will give your business new ways to work effectively with large amounts of data.<br />
<br />
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-reference#joins\">Big JOIN</a>: use SQL-like queries to join very large datasets at interactive speeds</li>
<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-reference#groupby\">Big Group Aggregations</a>: perform groupings on large numbers of distinct values&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-reference#timestampfunctions\">Timestamp</a>: native support for importing and querying Timestamp data&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />
With these capabilities, you will now be able to join and perform aggregate analysis on multi-terabyte datasets using SQL-like queries or integrated 3rd party tools, instead of having to initiate complex coding projects.<br />
<br />
We’ve been using this technology within Google. For example, when our App Engine team needed to reconcile app billing and usage information, Big JOIN allowed the team to merge 2TB of usage data with 10GB of configuration data in 60 seconds. Big Group Aggregations enabled them to immediately segment those results by customer.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;\">Using the integrated Tableau client the team was able to quickly visualize and detect some unexpected trends.</span><br />
<br />
Pricing remains the same: you pay only for the actual data that’s processed by your queries.<br />
<br />
Joining terabyte-sized tables has traditionally been a challenging task for data analysts, requiring sophisticated MapReduce development skills, powerful hardware, or a lot of time--often all three.  Today with BigQuery you can get directly to business insights using SQL-like queries, with far less effort and far greater speed than you could before.<br />
<br />

<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Our guest blogger this week is Jakub Zablocki, chairman of X-Trade Brokers, a brokerage firm founded in Poland in 2002 with locations in more than ten countries in Europe. X-Trade Brokers (XTB) is a European brokerage house specializing in financial instruments traded over both the over-the-counter market and major stock exchange.

<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-feknMTIcOJo/UUCqjWvpuOI/AAAAAAAABY4/YQ-pDQWrPIo/s1600/XTB+Logo.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-feknMTIcOJo/UUCqjWvpuOI/AAAAAAAABY4/YQ-pDQWrPIo/s1600/XTB+Logo.jpg\" /></a></div>
At X-Trade Brokers (XTB), our goal is to give our customers the information they need to make sound financial decisions. Like many industries, technology is playing a bigger role in our industry. We pride ourselves on being technologically advanced for our customers. It’s what they demand, whether its a robust online trading platform, a vibrant mobile ecosystem or the latest, up-to-the second update on a stock price. Now, we’ve decided to run our business on Google Apps.<br />
<br />
We chose Google Apps because we noticed a gap: we were providing our customers with the latest, most cutting edge technologies to manage their money we weren't doing the same for hundreds of our employees. Our previous solution, Microsoft Outlook, was an on-premise solution. It became too difficult to run a modern, fast-paced brokerage firm on yesterday’s technology - we weren’t providing the tools that our employees needed to keep up. With Google Apps, our employees will have access to information anytime, anywhere from any connected device, allowing them to work how and from where they please. Tools like Google Sites and Google Drive will give our employees the most modern tools available so they can serve our clients in the most efficient way possible. 
<br />
<br />
Google Apps offers a suite of tools we didn’t have access to before. Being in a highly regulated industry means we have to take extra precautions to ensure we save and store sensitive employee information such as email and chat records. On other platforms, this is cumbersome and requires a lot of work on both the IT side and employee side. With Google Apps Vault, that happens in the background, giving us both an enterprise-class way to store our most important information as well as a solution that doesn't get in the way. Our IT department is really looking forward to not having to store and manage this data. Many of our employees have grown up with the web and were already familiar with tools such as Gmail and Google Calendar which will make the transition seamless.  
<br />
<br />
In the financial services industry, speed is everything -- trading on information that’s even five minutes old can result in a risky investment. Our customers demand real-time information so they can make some of the most important decisions in their lives. With our previous technology solution, I always felt as if we were making a bet on old information but now, with the help of Google, our stock is at an all-time high.

<i><br /></i>
<br />
Founded in Switzerland in 1912, Holcim has become one of the world's leading suppliers of cement and aggregates. The Group also supplies ready-mix concrete and asphalt, and provides related services. We have production sites in about 70 countries on every continent - we’re more spread out globally than any other building materials group.
<br />
<br />
This business and geographical diversity gives us many advantages, but it also means that cross-functional and cross-regional communication and collaboration can be challenging. To meet this challenge and to unify the many such platforms in use across the Group, Holcim’s Executive Committee decided to roll-out Google Apps worldwide to our 40,000 IT users. We chose Google Apps because it will help us concentrate on our core businesses, and bring our employees, customers and partners across the globe closer together.
<br />
<br />
The introduction of Google Apps in our company over the coming years is aligned with the goals of the Holcim Leadership Journey, an initiative to promote customer excellence, increase operational efficiency and develop talent. Collaboration and the global spread of experiences and expertise will be easier, faster, and more efficient, in real-time and from anywhere via mobile and desktop devices. Over time, we believe Google Apps will help to create stronger relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners by directly involving them in online discussions, idea exchange and project work. Also, the innovative and interactive electronic workspaces Google Apps provides will help Holcim attract future generations of young talents to the Group.
<br />
<br />
In addition to the suite of communications and collaboration, we are going to set up three other Google Enterprise solutions: Google Search Appliance, Google App Engine, and Google Apps Vault, an add-on for Google Apps, which will help manage and archive all email data. With the introduction of Google Enterprise products, we are embracing modern cloud-based delivery models that ease the technical complexities of internal operations. Such a model takes away the technical complexities of internal operations and instead allows IT personnel to focus on closer involvement with their business counterparts in creating deeper business value.
<br />
<br />
The roll-out of Google Apps to Holcim Group companies will start in the summer of 2013. Google Apps will enable better collaboration and drive innovation around the world. We are excited to embark on this cultural change that will allow our employees to bring the tools they know and use in their personal lives into the workplace on Google Apps.

<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Boston’s changed a bit since Paul Revere set out on his famous midnight horseback ride in 1775. Belichick and Brady hadn’t met yet, the curse of the Big Bambino had yet to be cast (then broken), and Ben and Matt hadn’t won an Oscar for “Good Will Hunting.” But one thing has stayed the same in Boston over time: the city has been driven and defined by self-starters and homegrown businesses.
<br />
<br />
We’re wicked excited to highlight a few Boston businesses using Google Apps over the next few weeks. Today, we’ll hear from Kristin Phelan, Marketing Director at <a href=\"http://www.faneuilhallmarketplace.com/\">Faneuil Hall Marketplace</a>, a historic Boston landmark.

It’s not every day that you get to work in the same spot where Samuel Adams brought Bostonians together on the eve of the Boston Tea Party or where George Washington toasted the United States of America on its first birthday. As the Marketing Director at Faneuil Hall Marketplace, I help carry the legacy of America’s first marketplace forward.
<br />
<br />
Faneuil Hall is entrenched in its rich past, but part of my job is to make sure it also stays modern. We’ve recently started adding programs that reflect a new, more innovative and independent spirit: on top of the bustling retail space we’re historically known for, we’ve also hosted local musicians, NBC’s <i>The Today Show</i>, an LED light and sound show, pilates bootcamps and the Urban RAID obstacle course race. And each new day brings another new idea.
<br />
<br />
Coordinating all these activities requires a lot of communication and organization. It also requires a reliable technology platform - something we didn’t have until we moved to Google Apps last year. I remember the night I knew we had to switch. I was working late on a project, when all of the sudden I got a notification that my mailbox was full. I’d been using Gmail for my personal email and knew it would be a better solution for our team not only for storage, but for the rest of the tools in the suite. 
<br />
<br />
Getting Apps up and running was a snap. I’m no IT expert, but setting the team up with email and teaching them how to use Calendar, Drive and Docs was simple. In our first week, we set up a shared calendar to track our street performers, visiting artists, and events, so now everyone can see what's going on and when.
<br />
<br />
Apps doesn’t just help us stay organized – it also helps us work better together when we’re away from our desks. Just a few weeks ago, I was doing an on-site walk-through for an upcoming mural when a reporter called looking for pictures for an upcoming article. I jumped on my phone, opened the Drive app, and with just a few clicks, gave her access to the photo folder I had created for press inquiries.

I may not be an American Revolutionary, but I still get to help bring millions of people together at one of the country’s most revered landmarks. And thanks to Google Apps, we have the tools to keep our 271-year-old building in the 21st century.

<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Today’s guest blogger is Mr. Aramaki, Director of Innovation, All Nippon Airways (ANA) Japan. See what other organizations that have gone Google <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/customers.html#utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=en-na-us-entblog-Shaw12052012&amp;utm_campaign=en_us\">have to say</a>.</i>
<br />
<br />
As Japan’s largest airline, operating around 1,000 flights per day, we know a thing or two about clouds. Today we’re delighted to announce that we’ll be embarking on a journey to a cloud of a very different kind — with Google’s cloud based tools <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/enterprise/apps/business/\">Google Apps for Business</a>  — to communicate and collaborate more easily.
<br />
<br />
Starting in April, all our 33,000 staff across 40 company divisions,  from pilots and cabin attendants to HR and finance staff, will use Gmail, Google Drive and Google Talk.
<br />
<br />
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-snoZg-mJzMo/UTe5AFZJZ5I/AAAAAAAABYI/k42ZWo7UuJA/s1600/ANA+plane+-+approved.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-snoZg-mJzMo/UTe5AFZJZ5I/AAAAAAAABYI/k42ZWo7UuJA/s320/ANA+plane+-+approved.jpg\" /></a>
</div>
<br />
As a global business, we have people working all over the world. Now it doesn't matter if our staff are on tarmacs in Tokyo, offices in London, or on-the-go in the streets of Beijing, they’ll be able to communicate and collaborate in real time, using Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides from their PCs, smartphones or tablets. As well as removing the barriers of distance, the move to Google Apps will also help us break down language barriers with <a href=\"http://support.google.com/chat/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=172257\">Google Talk’s translation feature</a>.
<br />
<br />
Google Apps offers us the reliability and scalability we need. We coordinate flights for 2.7 million passengers to 81 local and international destinations every year, so it is critical we have a communication system that we can rely on. With Gmail we’ll not only have this reliability and scale, we’ll also no longer have to dedicate resources to maintaining and operating our email system as we can rely on Google’s infrastructure.
<br />
<br />
For over 60 years ANA has flown passengers around the world in comfort and safety. As we launch into our next decade were looking forward to smooth sailing into the cloud with Google Apps for Business and creating a more innovative, flexible and productive style of work.</div><div class=\"feedflare\">

<br />
<br />
The Information Services team for the City of Monterey is dedicated to providing the right resources and support for our workforce. We were using an aging and expensive Novell GroupWise email platform that held us back. We faced high overhead costs, a burdensome system administration, lack of innovation, no ability to collaborate and issues around integrating with other key data systems.
<br />
<br />
We spent a lot of time troubleshooting GroupWise problems: applying software updates to servers and clients, monitoring disk space usage, spam filter maintenance, troubleshooting server errors and connections to mobile devices and providing specialized user training. This time would have been better spent building our library of support resources for city employees. 
<br />
<br />
After a thorough evaluation of multiple replacement options, our IT department recommended, and our City Council approved, the purchase Google Apps for Government and associated services from Google reseller SADA Systems.
<br />
<br />
With help from SADA Systems, we moved all 460 employees in just 90 days, finishing in early January 2013. SADA provided an excellent project plan, project manager and technical assistance. I truly believe that without SADA’s assistance, this transition would not have been as easy and successful.
<br />
<br />
Our chief reasons for Going Google were low cost, 24/7 availability and security, ability to collaborate, minimal user training needed, and access to our data across different types of applications and mobile devices. We also appreciated Google’s conversion tools, which allowed us to migrate all our existing e-mail, calendar, and contact information with ease and minimize disruption to employees. 
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind: Monterey has dozens of offices located across the city and in the neighboring communities we support. It’s not just City Hall where our citizens go to get things done. We have public safety professionals, public works employees, employees with multiple types of mobile devices, fire stations, and service desks in different offices and nearby cities. The coordination and communication challenges in this distributed and decentralized environment were daunting, to say the least. 
<br />
<br />
Today, city employees in these dispersed locations communicate using Gmail, share documents in Drive, use Google’s instant messaging, and Sites to stay coordinated. We’re also piloting Google+ Hangouts as another way to streamline collaboration and communication among the different offices. Just recently our five fire stations, located in three different cities, successfully held their staff meeting in a Google+ Hangout. 
<br />
<br />
Switching to Google Apps will save the City 30 percent in IT costs over the next five years. The Information Services team can spend more time on implementing new technological solutions across the city. Even more important, this transition has empowered employees to do their jobs faster and with greater ease and efficiency, in turn, benefiting our citizens.

<br />
<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Our guest blogger this week is Mark Prestipino, Envista CEO.  Looking for ways to provide enhanced map capabilities to its utilities customers, Envista talks about integrating Google Maps Engine into its IRIS technology.  See what other organizations that have gone Google <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/earthmaps/customers.html\">have to say</a>.</i>
<br />
<br />
With miles and miles of underground pipeline and transmission lines to manage, the ability for our utility customers to quickly locate and keep track of their assets is vital to running a successful operation. Thanks to Google Maps Engine, we've been able to create a powerful map platform that makes this all possible.
<br />
<br />
IRIS, our newest solution for the utility industry, is a cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technology that allows an organization to develop custom map applications without the need for complex coding. Incorporating an organization’s business and location data into a single platform, IRIS apps provides the location-relevant information needed to efficiently maintain critical assets in the field. 
<br />
<br />
<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">
<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NnTFnnLGEfo/US-Rkk7z3YI/AAAAAAAABXk/jhTSvr-o06A/s1600/Envista+IRIS.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"285\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NnTFnnLGEfo/US-Rkk7z3YI/AAAAAAAABXk/jhTSvr-o06A/s400/Envista+IRIS.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>
<br />
The secret behind our IRIS technology is Google Maps Engine, which gives our customers three key benefits:<br />
<br />
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li><b>Scale</b>: Founded on Google’s core infrastructure, Google Maps Engine provides IRIS users with unrivaled scale and reliability. This enables the information and image-processing power needed to store, manage and publish maps with layers and layers of high resolution geospatial data.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Familiarity</b>: IRIS apps users can see their data visualized on a Google Map. This simple user interface -- combined with the incredible, up-to-date imagery of Google Earth -- lets people build their own map applications and understand what they see on a map with very little training.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Mobility</b>: With pipeline and asset management primarily taking place in the field, access to map data anytime, anywhere is critical. The Google Maps Engine cloud platform allows IRIS maps to be used in almost any environment -- mobile, remote or offline.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Maps are an invaluable tool for the utilities industry -- and so is scalable, simple-to-use technology. When it comes to providing our utilities customers with a map solution they can rely on, Google Maps Engine is the clear choice for us.

Classic Cinemas has been bringing families, couples, kids and film enthusiasts together in front of the silver screen for more than thirty years – around the time Christopher Reeve donned the famous tights and cape for “Superman” in 1978. Over the years, we’ve grown to 500 employees and over 13 movie theaters in and around Chicago. We’ve also outgrown the film technology we started with. After years of using 35-millimeter film projection systems, we upgraded to 4K Ultra High-Def Digital Projectors. We’re a true 21st century cinema.<br />
<br />
When I joined the IT department in 2012, it was clear we were in need of another upgrade – this time, from our Microsoft Exchange server. We had ongoing issues with downtime that cost the company a lot of money and the IT team a lot of time. We looked into cloud-based systems and Google Apps was exactly what we needed – the 99.9 percent uptime sold us.
<br />
<br />
We switched to Google Apps with the help of <a href=\"http://www.cloudsherpas.com/\">Cloud Sherpas</a> in August 2012 and couldn’t have been in better hands. At no point did we ever have a question that they couldn't answer. Data migration? They walked us through each step along the way and made sure we didn't lose a single megabyte. Change management? They ran webinars for all of our employees about moving from Outlook to Gmail, Word to Docs and Folders to Labels. They made switching feel seamless.
<br />
<br />
We created an employee intranet on Google Sites that houses all our necessary documents – employee schedules, upcoming screenings, movie schedules and parking lists, among others. This means everything important sits in one single place, and everyone on the team can access it. No more wild goose chases over email and no more bothering groups of people with email barrages.
<br />
<br />
Google Apps also helped us bring our maintenance request system up to date. Before we switched over, people wrote out their problems in a Word doc and emailed them to us, then we printed them out, tracked them on a bulletin board, and took them down one by one as the maintenance team went on-site to handle each issue. With Cloud Sherpas’ help, we built a Google Form on our intranet, so now everyone submits their requests online. The Form automatically feeds into a spreadsheet, which alerts the maintenance team that work needs to be done. We’ve been able to dramatically reduce administration time and boost our productivity to a new level. We now have complete history and statistics capabilities, as well as the ability to identify trends and be more proactive.
<br />
<br />
Just as digital technology helped us move into the modern era of film, Google Apps has helped us adapt to the future of business. It’s been a smash hit for us - just like “Superman” was back in the day.

Egan Construction is an approximately 800-person construction company in Minnesota currently working on the Central Corridor Light Rail, the biggest construction project in the history of the North Star State. The Light Rail will stretch 11 miles through five major areas of interest, and is expected to be done in 2014. As CIO of Egan, I want to provide my organization with technology that helps connect the job site with the main office, the tools and parts warehouses and our executives.
<br />
<br />
A year ago, we were looking for a solution that would avoid having a fleet of expensive, quickly outdated and slow Microsoft Windows laptops that constantly break or need replacing. I’ve heard stories from other construction firms that Monday mornings were like the movie Groundhog Day, with the IT team tackling the same four-foot high stack of malware-infected laptops over and over while work ground to a halt. I didn’t want to experience that.
<br />
<br />
After surveying the market, we decided to move to Chromebooks for our 140-person foreman staff. They’re lightweight, turn on and off in an instant, and provide easy access to business apps that we use every day.
<br />
<br />
Chromebooks also integrate nicely with Google Apps, which we use to run our business in the field. The workers love the Chromebooks because they aren’t afraid to use them on the job. If one does get damaged, we can swap it out for another one in a matter of minutes, with zero time wasted or data lost. Also, we’ve saved so much in moving forward with Chromebooks instead of Windows laptops - about $200 per machine. 
<br />
<br />
Rolling out Chromebooks to our staff was extremely easy. We have two people and an intern in our IT support department, and I wanted the intern to manage the deployment process. I figured he’d only get so far, then my IT guys would have to jump in, but he did it all on his own. If I would have rolled out the same number of Windows laptops, I would have had to hire additional staff just to manage that. And with Chromebooks, we haven’t been plagued with ongoing support requests.  
<br />
<br />
The scale of the light rail project really brings to light how valuable the Chromebooks have become to our organization. At Egan, we take pride in the fact that we’re building something that so many Minnesotans will use. The light rail will bring people together that didn’t have an easy way to connect previously. I like to think Chromebooks have done the same for Egan.

Every day, millions of companies, schools and governments around the world run their organizations on Google’s enterprise solutions, including Google Apps, the Google Search Appliance, Google Maps and Earth, and Google Cloud Platform. We’re committed to helping these organizations succeed, but we can’t do it alone; our partners play a crucial role in ensuring customers get the most out of the technology they use. Companies rely on our partners to provide everything from hands-on deployment and technical support to customized applications that integrate seamlessly with Google’s products.
<br />
<br />
Today, we kicked off our inaugural Global Partner Summit at our headquarters in Mountain View, CA. More than 400 partner leaders from around the world are joining us for three days of training, planning and sharing best practices. We’ll also take time at the Summit to recognize the great work that so many of our partners have done helping businesses embrace new solutions and move to the cloud.
<br />
<br />
Googlers joining our partners this week to discuss the state and future of business technology include Vint Cerf, Google’s Chief Internet Evangelist; Patrick Pichette, Google’s Chief Financial Officer; Urs Hölzle, Senior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure; Amit Singh, President of Google Enterprise.

To help partners build their expertise and prepare for certification exams, we’re launching a partner university. The university will feature a combination of self-guided online courses, instructor-led online courses, and in-person classes that can be taken individually or sequentially. We’re also doing more to recognize outstanding resellers across different products. Two years ago, we began recognizing certain Google Apps resellers as <a href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/06/google-reseller-program-sets-new.html\">premier resellers</a>. Today, we’re adding similar ‘premier’ designations for our top partners in our Search Reseller Program and our brand new Maps for Business Reseller Program. 
<br />
<br />
Finally, for their expertise and dedication to meeting customers’ business and technology needs, we’d like to congratulate our 2012 Global partners of the year:<br />
<br />
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li><b>Google Apps - Customer Acquisition</b>: Softbank (Japan)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Google Apps - Implementation</b>: Cloud Sherpas (USA and APAC)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Enterprise Search</b>: Onix Networking (USA)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Maps for Business</b>: SPH (Korea)&nbsp;</li>

<br />
<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Our guest blogger this week is Peter Hutterer, Content Manager at <a href=\"http://www.post.at/\">Österreichische Post AG</a>, Austria’s leading logistics and postal service provider.</i><br />
<br />
<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dw353zCfpQU/USZqHdI0-CI/AAAAAAAABWU/VCLqh1MWK_M/s1600/POST_4C_POSITIV.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img align=\"left\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dw353zCfpQU/USZqHdI0-CI/AAAAAAAABWU/VCLqh1MWK_M/s320/POST_4C_POSITIV.jpg\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" /></a>Österreichische Post AG is the leading logistics and postal service provider in Austria with about 20.000 employees. More than eight million Austrians trust us every day to deliver their letters, advertising materials and packages securely and quickly. As a stock market listed company, we make an important contribution towards maintaining and securing the communication and logistics infrastructure in Austria. We always look to the latest technologies to further enhance the quality of our service, and are convinced that good service is only possible if our customers, employees and partners can find what they are looking for quickly and easily.
<br />
<br />
That is why we chose to implement the Google Search Appliance 7.0. The recently launched project – first implementing GSA for our website and online shop pages and later using it for our intranet – is expected to be completed by mid-2013. Then, 9,000 employees across Austria will use the GSA, which will allow them to locate internal information and documents, share these with the entire workforce and improve our internal networking. 
<br />
<br />
The personalized intranet search experience enabled by the GSA is another key factor that played a role in the decision to go with Google’s Enterprise Search solution. With the GSA, we can also search within the organisation for experts in different subject areas, and thus tap into the “wisdom of many” across all our locations to execute our work. In addition, while up to now we've been using various search engines within the company, the move to one and intuitive GSA will lower our IT spend. 
<br />
<br />
However, GSA doesn’t just give our employees a fast and easy search experience that yields the most relevant results; our customers also benefit from our implementation of the Google search solution. They are used to finding everything they need extremely fast by searching on Google.at. And now the GSA will give them the same experience on our website, making it easier to navigate the jungle of our diverse service portfolio, including information about package rates, mail forwarding services, e-letters, store locations and more. The GSA helps people find the right information faster and delivers the most relevant results for their queries.  What’s more, with the GSA, our IT staff can better analyze customer search queries, which, in turn, lets them design the website to be more user-friendly. But that’s not the end of it: in the future, we will use GSA to better calibrate our service offers to make sure we meet and exceed the needs of our customers.

<br />
Support is as important as product features when choosing a platform for your applications. And let’s face it, sometimes we all need a bit of help. No matter which <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform</a> services you are using—App Engine, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, etc.—or what time of day, you should be able to get the answers you need. While you can go to Stack Overflow or Google Groups, we realize some of you may need 24x7 coverage, phone support or direct access to a Technical Account Manager team. 
<br />
<br />
To meet your support requirements, we’re introducing a comprehensive collection of support packages for services on Google Cloud Platform, so you can decide what level best fits your needs:<br />
<br />
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li><b>Bronze</b>: All customers get access to online documentation, community forums, and billing support. (Free)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Silver</b>: In addition to Bronze, you can email our support team for questions related to product functionality, best practices, and service errors. ($150/month)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Gold</b>: In addition to Silver, you'll receive 24x7 phone support and consultation on application development, best practices or architecture for your specific use case. (Starts at $400/month)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Platinum</b>: The most comprehensive and personalized support. In addition to Gold, you’ll get direct access to a Technical Account Manager team. (<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/support/signup\">Contact Sales</a> for more information)</li>

With a new academic year comes a new way of learning.<br />
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">

Increasingly primary, secondary, and university students and faculty are using  Google Apps for Education, a free suite of productivity tools designed to help people work together better.  This also include three top-tier universities in Australia who are going back to school this year with Google Apps. The universities of Griffith, Macquarie and Monash join the community of thousands of institutions worldwide using Google Apps for Education to enhance their students’ learning and to increase organizational efficiency.  This community includes 72 of the top 100 schools in the USA and 20 million students and teachers worldwide.<br />
<br />
Griffith University is a leading research university with a strong international focus spread over 5 campuses.  They were looking for an easy-to-use communication and collaboration platform that offered more storage capacity and a better user interface, regardless of access device or location.<br />
<br />
Monash University has a presence in Malaysia, South Africa, India, Italy and China, and benefits from being able to streamline communication among its dispersed students and staff.<br />
<br />
<i>“How could you not consider Google Apps in the world we are in today? It, to me, is the best productivity tool you could imagine, in the most intuitive fashion.”&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>—Adam Shoemaker, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education), Monash University</i><br />

Macquarie University was in fact the first university in Australia, and amongst the first in the world, to offer Gmail to their students, setting up 68,000 accounts back in 2007.  Since then, they have switched on more and more of the suite’s features, and in 2012 even became the first Australian university to map its campus 3 dimensionally in Google Earth.<br />

<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Wf3X9RRJA-U\" width=\"560\"></iframe>&nbsp;</div>
Several students from each of these universities have also been appointed as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/students/proscho/programs/australia/ambassador/\">Google Student Ambassadors</a> this year, and will join students from 25 other universities this week in our Sydney office. They will learn first-hand how Google Apps for Education can help to uncover a new way of learning, and help others on their campuses to use technology for good.<br />

It may sound obvious, but sometimes the best way to find something is to start looking. Beginning today, Google Drive will let you quickly preview more than <a href=\"http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2423485\">30 file types</a> and quickly flip between files until you find the one you want.
<br />
<br />
You’ll see the new preview automatically if you open a photo, video, or PDF. To see a preview of a Google document, right-click on the file name and select “preview.” Once the preview window is open, you can click on the arrows on either side to flip to other files. And right from within the preview, you can watch video files or scroll through multi-page documents. 
<br />
<br />
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">

</div>
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<br /></div>
You can select and copy text from the preview -- even for a PDF or Microsoft Word document -- or use the zoom buttons to see a file in more detail. Each file preview also gives you one-click access to share, download, print or open a file for editing.

<br />
Rolling green hills, a skyline of trees and no traffic in sight. Yes, this is Thailand. Today in partnership with the prestigious Mae Fah Luang University, we’re supporting an educational institution famous for its breathtaking natural environment in their vision to become a Green University by going Google.
<br />
<br />
<div style=\"text-align: center;\">
<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-31K0JHY5i0Y/USOueqdryWI/AAAAAAAABVs/lKYrHkr5j3I/s1600/MFU+goes+Google_6.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"215\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-31K0JHY5i0Y/USOueqdryWI/AAAAAAAABVs/lKYrHkr5j3I/s400/MFU+goes+Google_6.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a><br />
<br /></div>
Through the Google Apps for Education Support Program, 14,000 teachers, students and staff from Mae Fah Luang University will now use Google’s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/edu/teachers/educator-resources.html\">collection of free email and open collaboration tools</a>, including Gmail, Google+, Docs, Calendar and Groups, and be the first educational institution in northern Thailand to go Google.
<br />
<br />
Being cloud enabled means students and teachers can take full advantage of the web and collaborate wherever they are. No matter if they are on a bus, at home, or enjoying one of the many beautiful gardens on the Mae Fah Luang University campus. Leading-edge technologies, like cloud computing and collaborative tools, have a vital role to play in helping equip future generations with the skills they need to thrive in the workforce of today and tomorrow. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Why is going Google greener?</b><br />
In addition to supporting learning, the move to the cloud will also help Mae Fah Luang  achieve their sustainability goals. Our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/green/\">energy efficiency efforts</a> mean our cloud is greener, ensuring that colleges, universities and businesses that use our cloud based tools, such as Gmail and Google Apps, are greener too. <a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en/us/green/pdf/google-apps.pdf\">Our analysis suggests</a> that a typical organization can achieve substantial energy and carbon savings—ranging from 65 to 85 percent—by migrating to Google Apps and that an organization using Gmail can <a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en//green/pdfs/google-green-computing.pdf\">decrease its environmental</a> impact by up to 98 percent.
<br />
<br />
Just 9 months ago, we were excited to announce the first university in Thailand to go Google in Khon Kaen province. Today 13 educational institutions and more than 300,000 students, teachers and academics in Thailand have gone Google, and that’s just the beginning.</div>

ICOM Productions is a 100-person company focused on helping companies better engage and develop their employees by freshening up their training programs. We pride ourselves on being progressive, young and vibrant; we encourage our employees to question old habits, push the envelope and change the way we teach and learn every day. 
<br />
<br />
When I joined as VP of Operations less than a year ago, I was shocked by how our progressive mentality clashed with our old, slow and unreliable technology. We were using a piecemeal technology solution built around Microsoft® Exchange that made everyday processes disjointed and inefficient. We wanted employees from each of our three offices to be able to collaborate on projects, but the process of emailing versions back and forth and editing them in silos wasn't quite the collaboration we were looking for. We knew we needed something better, but upgrading to the newest Exchange Server would have cost us a fortune and still leave us three years behind the latest technology.
<br />
<br />
It turned out that our forward-thinking employees were pushing the envelope with technology on the side, too: they'd started using their personal Google accounts at work. They were sharing files through Google Drive and creating project hubs with Google Sites. Over the next few months, we talked with our employees and <a href=\"http://www.agosto.com/\">Agosto</a>, a Google Apps Reseller, and we came to a clear conclusion: moving ICOM to Google Apps was the best path forward. In the Fall of 2012, Agosto partnered with our technical team to put a migration plan in place, and 30 days later, all 100 employees were on Apps. It was the fastest IT implementation I’ve ever done.
<br />
<br />
Google+ Hangouts have completely revolutionized our recruiting process. Instead of relying on phone screenings, which don’t really convey a candidate’s personality, or flying people to Calgary, which is expensive, we use Hangouts, which cost nothing and bring each prospect’s character to life. We like to do group interviews via Hangouts to see how people think and interact - group collaboration is huge at ICOM, and you get a good sense of that over video conference. Our candidates love that we’re using new technology and we love that we’re still getting the same valuable insight about our candidates. 
<br />
<br />
Google Apps has helped us be more efficient, more forward-thinking and more cost-effective. It’s also helped us strengthen the ICOM culture we pride ourselves on - being creative, asking thought-provoking questions and working as a team. All of this, of course, means that we’re getting better at what we do: helping other companies teach and train their employees more effectively. Just like what Apps has done for us.</div>

<br><br>
<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O--IQXihm9Q/UR0MvbNO-5I/AAAAAAAABVY/xGZtllSg4SM/s1600/PGR+Logo+Black.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"5\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O--IQXihm9Q/UR0MvbNO-5I/AAAAAAAABVY/xGZtllSg4SM/s320/PGR+Logo+Black.jpg\" /></a><br><br>
At Prudential Georgia Realty, our associates work hard to deliver valuable services to their clients.  Their work ethic and great skills have helped us become the largest real estate company in the Greater Metro Atlanta area. We were <a href=\"http://www.atlrealestatescoop.com/realtrends-recognizes-pgr-as-one-of-top-17-brokerages-in-the-nation/\">recently named by REALTrends</a> as one of only 17 real estate companies in the country to increase its sales volume, agent headcount and agent productivity over the last 10 years. 
<br><br>
With more than 1,000 agents in 22 offices, spread out over 43 counties around Atlanta, it is critical for our agents and staff to communicate efficiently with current and potential clients. Communication is the backbone of our business - our agents have to manage a lot of contacts, files, photos and other information and they need access on their mobile devices. We had two separate email systems, a hosted Microsoft® Exchange 2007 server for employees and an open source solution for our agents. We wanted to migrate to a single system that allowed us to support the transition to a more virtual working environment and foster better collaboration internally. Another consideration was the ability for our agents to organize and manage their contacts into groups so they could run campaigns and stay in contact using any of their devices. After a careful evaluation, we decided to move to the Google Apps platform.   
<br><br>
We migrated the employees to Google Apps in December and have already seen an improvement in our communication. When our agents go live, Google Apps will help them run their business from any location using any device. Google Groups will let agents easily organize and manage their client and contact lists, so with one click they can send more relevant marketing content to a specific group of people. Most importantly, since it’s all in the cloud, these Groups will automatically sync to any device so the agent can follow up with a personal phone call.    
<br><br>
Google Drive allows us to share large files and documents and manage the security at the same time. We plan to implement Google Sites, so each branch or division will have a searchable and sharable place to store information like a high resolution photos. Teams can work together on projects more effectively and collaborate on live documents. Agents will now be able to create personalized Google Sites tailored to specialized groups of prospects like first time buyers, baby boomers, or potential luxury home buyers.  
<br><br>
Real estate is a very competitive business. Google Apps puts the information at our fingertips, which gives us a leg up. Leveraging the right technology can be game changing for the real estate industry, and we’re excited to be a leader in that effort.<div class=\"feedflare\">

<br><br>
<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Today’s guest blogger is Lou Giannotti, CIO at the <a href=\"http://www.usna.edu/homepage.php \">United States Naval Academy</a>, the undergraduate institution of the United States naval service.</i>
<br><br>
<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XD56JVJVzKo/URu4W9RxnXI/AAAAAAAABUA/WuvoEW-s_Pk/s1600/USNA+logo.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right:10px\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XD56JVJVzKo/URu4W9RxnXI/AAAAAAAABUA/WuvoEW-s_Pk/s320/USNA+logo.jpg\" /></a>
The United States Naval Academy (USNA) has graduated more than 78,000 young men and women to serve in America’s naval service since being founded in 1845. The technological landscape of the country has changed dramatically over the past decade, and USNA has kept pace by providing its students, called midshipmen, with the educational resources required to be effective Navy and Marine Corps officers upon graduation.
<br><br>
Similar to other top educational institutions such as the Ivy League schools, Stanford and MIT, USNA is in constant flux and continuously trying to stay on the technological cutting edge. Thousands of midshipmen enter and depart each year, all requiring mandatory and standardized email addresses and account changes. This presents a significant challenge of ensuring old email accounts are properly deleted and new accounts created quickly. Faculty, staff, and midshipmen rely on a wide array of smartphones and tablets for communication and collaboration.
<br><br>
For years, USNA employed an appliance-based email solution that offered secure communications, but proved to be expensive and limiting over time. USNA paid a hefty license fee for every mobile device accessing email. With the exploding mobile component of the environment, we sought an alternative solution.
<br><br>
During an analytical review of alternatives, USNA discovered the bulk of the 4,400 midshipmen were using personal Gmail accounts. USNA embarked on a trial of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/government/index.html#utm_medium=blog&utm_source=en-na-us-entblog-USNA02132013&utm_campaign=en_us\">Google Apps for Government</a>, providing midshipmen Gmail while allowing USNA to protect school data from uncontrolled exposure to the public domain. It provided a full suite of communication and collaboration tools such as Docs and Calendar. Coincidently, Google Apps for Government also provided universal mobile access with no additional licensing costs.
<br><br>
USNA began with 100 users putting Google Apps through its paces, including testing much needed capabilities like using Calendar to schedule resources like rooms and equipment, and sharing documents for collaborative efforts. Following a successful trial, phase two included applying Google Apps to all faculty, staff, and midshipmen. Today, Google Apps supports approximately 7,200 users at USNA.
<br><br>
We use Gmail the most, with some faculty using its chat feature to communicate with midshipmen for official purposes. USNA maintains roughly four terabytes of mail without the burden of operating onsite storage and backup systems. More and more users are also taking advantage of Docs and Calendar. In fact, the midshipmen and faculty create an average of 5,000 Google Docs daily. Users enjoy the sharing capabilities, enabling greater collaboration. This is enhanced further as Google Apps allows access on any device users choose.
<br><br>
Google Apps provides USNA with flexibility and enables management of the constant change of midshipmen turnover at a lower cost than before. The mobile access alone makes Google Apps a worthwhile investment at $50 per person. It lets us make better use of the taxpayer’s dollars. The greatest value is the ease of creating and sharing information between midshipmen, faculty, and other institutions making Google Apps a core collaborative asset in the educational process.<div class=\"feedflare\">

<a href=\"http://allrecipes.com/\">Allrecipes.com</a> started in 1997, when Tim Hunt couldn’t find his favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe online. He vowed that other cooks like him shouldn’t have to deal with the same problem, and started CookieRecipe.com. From there, he created even more recipe sites that eventually came together into the site we know today: Allrecipes.com. Fifteen years after that cookie baking epiphany, we have more than one million user-generated recipes and 30 million visitors per month. That’s a lot of people looking for more than just chocolate chip treats.
<br><br>
I took over as IT director for Allrecipes.com a year ago, and fixing our aging email system sat at the very top of my first to-do list. We culled our top options—Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Office 365, and Google Apps for Business—and put them through the ringer. After testing, analysis, and focus groups, Google Apps came out on top. With the help of our partner, <a href=\"http://www.cloudsherpas.com/\">Cloud Sherpas</a>, we moved all of Allrecipes.com employees over. Changing old habits is hard, especially when it comes to technology, but after just five months, it feels like Google Apps is second nature to us.
<br><br>
We want all of our employees to be able to work from wherever they are, with whatever device they have with them. With Google Apps, they can do just that - we use a mixture of mobile devices and operating systems, and our teams can switch seamlessly between them. I don’t always have my laptop with me, but with the Google Drive mobile app, I just jump into a doc on my smartphone or tablet to review or edit it, whether it’s during a meeting or on the way to the airport. Needing to fix a document on the fly doesn’t mean needing a computer anymore. We move quickly. Apps moves with us.
<br><br>
Hangouts also help us stay connected. Our social media manager recently moved to Australia, but with Hangouts, it’s almost as if she never left. We have video conferences with her throughout the week, and you wouldn’t know she’s halfway around the world. Our technical teams also use Hangouts for off-hours maintenance. They get excited about being able to see who they’re working with as if they were both in the office, interacting as if they were in person, and sharing their screens to help expedite problem solving. We love that video conferencing is so seamlessly integrated with the entire Apps suite, and we don’t have to use or pay for a separate program. 
<br><br>
Food is more than just food – it brings people together and creates shared experiences. At Allrecipes.com, we’re proud to provide so many people with the foundation for those experiences. Google Apps brings our company closer so we can focus on helping home cooks make magic in their kitchens, one cookie or casserole at a time.<div class=\"feedflare\">

<br><br> 
Skin care has been our core expertise for 130 years. From our headquarters in Germany, we at Beiersdorf AG market one of the world’s most successful skin care brands: NIVEA. In order to move forward in an industry that we've been in for a long time, it’s important for us to have a finger on the pulse of the market and focus on the ever-changing needs of our customers. Today, more of our customers are using the Internet to find our products and we wanted to make that an easy experience for them. 
<br><br> 
Google Search Appliance offers visitors to our websites a significantly enhanced experience. It is a scalable hardware solution that offers a Google-like search experience for our public NIVEA websites worldwide. For our users, it offers the same kind of easy, fast and relevant search experience that they know from Google.com, while our company benefits from complete flexibility and control over the online user search experience. That is a great help to us, particularly when it comes to turning potential customers into real ones. We have now rolled out the Google Search Appliance globally for a total of 74 conventional and 12 mobile, country-specific websites of the NIVEA brand.
<br><br> 
Google Search Appliance has personalized and improved the visitors’ experience on NIVEA websites: when searching for products, they receive country-specific suggestions and results that also adapt based on patterns in the respective market. For example, if a site visitor in Germany starts his or her search with \"de\", the first suggestion he or she will see is “deo ohne aluminium”, while the same query in France will suggest “devenir testeuse nivea”. So that the search process actually yields successful results, searches in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Dutch and Arabic are supported by extensive features such as integrated thesaurus and an automatic, self-learning spellcheck function. The upshot is that the Google technology now makes it a whole lot easier for our customers to search for content that is relevant to them.

<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RhpHwd4gKZk/URJ_hQ0kf7I/AAAAAAAABSY/rti3NRYazQU/s1600/HRAll_CPVR_4C%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear:left; float:left;margin-right:1em; margin-bottom:1em\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"203\" width=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RhpHwd4gKZk/URJ_hQ0kf7I/AAAAAAAABSY/rti3NRYazQU/s320/HRAll_CPVR_4C%2B%25281%2529.png\" /></a></div>


At Hard Rock hotels, we don’t want to be a normal hotel; we want our guests to feel like rock stars from the moment they walk in the door. But, with 1,200 employees that use our IT platform across four locations, it can be challenging to create a consistent guest experience. We need tools that help us make decisions in the moment -- the party doesn’t stop at the Hard Rock!
<br><br>
As the IT Corporate Director of the All Inclusive Collection (which runs all of the Hard Rock Hotels in Mexico and the Dominican Republic), I’m responsible for providing tools to our employees that will let them to work together effectively and focus on our customers. On our old system, Microsoft® Exchange, we had a large datacenter for the hotels to maintain. Our communication tools weren’t flexible enough to make decisions on the go and we couldn’t guarantee that we were running the same promotions at the same time. We worried about the effect on our guests’ experience. I decided that we needed to move to Google Apps and get off of our on-premise infrastructure. Google Apps was fast, safe, and agile and met all of the security standards I was looking for, so I knew that all of our customers’ information would be protected, too!
<br><br>
Since moving to Google Apps, we've improved internal communication and are now spending half as much time on things as we were previously. While our hotels are in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, our sales teams are located all over the globe—North America, Europe, Asia, and here in Latin America—and they’re moving all the time. With Google Talk and Google+ Hangouts, we rarely use the phone anymore, it’s easier to jump on a Hangout from any device and from any of our locations.  When our sales team in Miami make an important reservation for a wedding or a big group, they chat via Google Talk with the hotel in Cancun, providing immediate assurance and confirmation that everything will run smoothly.
<br><br>
Having so many guests across our hotels, problems can arise at anytime day or night, so we can’t have downtime. Rather than worrying about keeping our servers and email running, we spend our time managing tools through a browser. We've saved thousands of dollars in IT infrastructure and telecommunication costs, and my IT headaches are gone. I used to have a team of guys helping me manage servers and keep our email up and running. Now, only two of us manage all of the tools. 
<br><br>
Google Sites and Google Calendar have been fundamental in organizing our promotions and standardizing our guest experience by allowing us to share across hotel locations. We just had a promotion across all our branches for Christmas and the holidays. We made a  site with all of the dates, rates, and details of the deal and we could easily monitor how it was rolled out across each hotel. This process used to take weeks, and fixing discrepancies between the locations was messy. Now, it’s simple, consistent, and happens in real time.
<br><br>
On Google Apps, we really feel like a team, working together despite being countries apart. We are able to provide the same level of rockstar service in all of our hotels and create great experiences for our guests. All while improving our customer experience – rock on!<div class=\"feedflare\">

<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Staying safe on the internet means being smart whenever you're online -- at home, at work and on your mobile device. The tips shared below are intended to help you protect yourself and your family. For more information about what Google does to protect our enterprise customers' data, check out our <a href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/search/label/%23top10trust\">trust series</a> on this blog and our <a href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/09/google-apps-data-protections-verified.html\">security white paper</a>. </i>

Technology can sometimes be complicated, but you shouldn’t have to be a computer scientist or security expert to stay safe online. Protecting our users is one of our top priorities at Google. Whether it’s creating easy-to-use tools to help you manage your information online or fighting the bad guys behind the scenes, we’re constantly investing to make Google the best service you can rely on, with security and privacy features that are on 24-7 and working for you.
<br />
<br />
Last year, we <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/tech-tips-that-are-good-to-know.html\">launched</a> <a href=\"http://google.com/goodtoknow\">Good to Know</a>, our biggest-ever campaign focused on making the web a safer, more comfortable place. Today, on Safer Internet Day, we’re updating Good to Know to include more tips and advice to help you protect yourself and your family from identity theft, scams and online fraud. You can also learn how to make your computer or mobile device more secure, and get more out of the web — from searching more effectively to making calls from your computer. And you can find out more about how Google works to make you, your device and the whole web safer.

<br />
For example, we encrypt the Gmail and Google Search traffic between your computer and Google -- this protects your Google activity from being snooped on by others. We also make this protection, known as session-wide SSL encryption, the default when you’re signed into Google Drive. Because outdated software makes your computer more vulnerable to security problems, we built the Chrome browser to auto-update to the latest version every time you start it. It gives you up-to-date security protection without making you do any extra work.
<br />
<br />
Even if you don’t use Google, we work hard to make the web safer for you. Every day we identify more than 10,000 unsafe websites — and we inform users and other web companies what we’ve found. We show warnings on up to 14 million Google Search results and 300,000 downloads, telling our users that there might be something suspicious going on behind a particular website or link. We share that data with other online companies so they can warn their users.
<br />
<br />
We know staying safe online is important to you — and it is important to us too. That's why we've had independent third parties <a href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/09/google-apps-data-protections-verified.html\">perform inspections and audits</a> for the data protections in Google Apps.

Chromebooks help educators improve teaching and learning, whether it’s in one classroom like <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B__OTXR_u3RbclVVcUE2R0tjbUk/edit\">Mr. Hathorn’s History Class in Vermont</a> or for 17,000 students in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B__OTXR_u3RbZHl0Y3dtdVpwLWs/edit\">an entire school district in Richland Two, South Carolina</a>.  To start your school’s journey you can tune into one of the Hangouts On Air next week on <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+GoogleinEducation/posts\">the Google in Education Google+ Page</a>.  During these Hangouts we’ll provide more information about Chromebooks for Education and will answer audience questions.<br />

Businesses around the world are also using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/devices/\">Chromebooks</a> where they need greater security and increased shareability. For example, Chromebooks enable employees like those on retail shop floors, manufacturing lines and out in the field, giving them access to central information and providing more timely updates on remote conditions. This is helping businesses to make better decisions faster.

Today we <a href=\"http://chrome.blogspot.com/2013/03/bringing-chromebooks-to-new-frontiers.html\">announced</a> that Chromebooks are now available in six more countries around the world. Hand-in-hand with several reseller partners, we’ve worked so that you can also purchase Chromebooks for businesses and schools in these same countries.

More than 2,000 schools are now using Chromebooks for Education. Chromebooks help educators improve teaching and learning, whether it’s in one classroom like <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B__OTXR_u3RbclVVcUE2R0tjbUk/edit\">Mr. Hathorn’s History Class in Vermont</a> or for 17,000 students in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B__OTXR_u3RbZHl0Y3dtdVpwLWs/edit\">an entire school district in Richland Two, South Carolina</a>.  To start your school’s journey you can tune into one of the Hangouts On Air next week on <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+GoogleinEducation/posts\">the Google in Education Google+ Page</a>.  During these Hangouts we’ll provide more information about Chromebooks for Education and will answer audience questions.<br />

<br />
Businesses around the world are also using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/devices/\">Chromebooks</a> where they need greater security and increased shareability. For example, Chromebooks enable employees like those on retail shop floors, manufacturing lines and out in the field, giving them access to central information and providing more timely updates on remote conditions. This is helping businesses to make better decisions faster.

Back in 2006, two MIT alumni decided there had to be a better way to do marketing. Dharmesh Shah and Brian Halligan knew that loud, interruptive and unwanted advertising wasn’t the way to help businesses attract customers, not to mention that new technology like caller ID and spam filters was simultaneously rendering those legacy efforts less effective. So they started HubSpot, and with it, a new paradigm that would be better for both marketers and customers, replacing loud, interruptive advertising with marketing consumers actually love.
<br />
<br />
HubSpot has grown to 450 employees since launching in 2006, and along the way, we've settled on a core mantra when it comes to how we work: “use good judgment.” We don’t tell employees where they have to work or when they have to be here - we care most about results. It’s imperative, then, that we leverage enterprise tools that make work easy and accessible anytime and anywhere. That’s why we use Google Apps. It lets us work together whether we’re at our desks or halfway around the world. That, combined with the fact that it grows with us and is simple to use, makes it the perfect solution for our company.
<br />
<br />
Our employees use Google Apps every day on nearly every aspect of our business. With Docs, Sheets and Slides, we’re able to collaborate on our most important documents with our colleagues, no matter where we are. We can store all our files in one place with Drive, so each team knows they can find their templates and notes whether they’re sitting down with their laptops or traveling with their smartphones. And Google Forms makes tracking executive speaking requests simple and seamless. Any time an organization wants a HubSpot expert to talk at an event, we send them a form with a set of standard questions, and the information they submit about the opportunity is automatically populated into a spreadsheet that houses all other requests. It's perfectly efficient.
<br />
<br />
Google Calendar helps us stay transparent, which we consider essential to empowering our employees. Many of our executives book office hours on Google Calendar and share them with our company. Any employee at any level can sign up for an hour with them, where they can bring up anything from product development ideas to problems they’re having at work.
<br />
<br />
Working for a fast-moving company isn’t easy, but with Google Apps, we’re not burdened by the hassles that can otherwise grind busy days to a halt without a strong technology platform. We don’t have to deal with attachments, version history screwups, email outages or fussing around with our phones to get our email to sync. We open up Google Apps and it works. It’s the same experience we offer with our software – simple, effective and lovable.</div>

Prisma Media is a French magazine publisher with approximately 20 titles in subjects such as photography, art and travel. From how to take the best photos to how to properly cook a souffle, our titles, including National Geographic, Female Current and Current Kitchen, have been informing and entertaining readers for years.
<br />
<br />
As Director of Information Systems at Prisma Media, it’s my job to keep a finger on the pulse of how our employees are using technology. Just as the publishing industry has had sweeping changes the past few years, so too has the way our employees use technology. Last year, I discovered a few enterprising employees who were forgoing our hosted corporate email system in favor of Gmail. They had reached the limit of their email storage and needed a way to stay productive.
<br />
<br />
Traditionally, bringing outside, unsupported technology into the workplace is fraught with concerns around security, lack of manageability and control. Other companies might have quickly revoked access to Gmail for the employees in question and reminded them of the standard company policy when it comes to using unsupported technology at work. Instead, we chose to look at this as an opportunity and reevaluated our technology environment.
<br />
<br />
We decided to go with Google Apps for Business for a number of reasons. First, Apps requires much less support than our previous solution. Simply by going Google, we cut our IT support calls by approximately 30 percent, which saved us money and freed up our IT department for other tasks. The second reason was cost. By switching to Google we cut our email costs by approximately one-third, which is a lot, especially when you consider we’re getting access to a much better, more modern product. Lastly, the switch itself was seamless. By working with Google Apps Reseller GPartner, we were able to continue to manage and run our business without missing a beat, while GPartner handled the switch in approximately 45 days.
<br />
<br />

Prisma Media is a French magazine publisher with approximately 20 titles in subjects such as photography, art and travel. From how to take the best photos to how to properly cook a souffle, our titles, including National Geographic, Female Current and Current Kitchen, have been informing and entertaining readers for years. 
<br />
<br />
As Director of Information Systems at Prisma Media, it’s my job to keep a finger on the pulse of how our employees are using technology. Just as the publishing industry has had sweeping changes the past few years, so too has the way our employees use technology. Last year, I discovered a few enterprising employees who were forgoing our hosted corporate email system in favor of Gmail. They had reached the limit of their email storage and needed a way to stay productive.
<br />
<br />
Traditionally, bringing outside, unsupported technology into the workplace is fraught with concerns around security, lack of manageability and control. Other companies might have quickly revoked access to Gmail for the employees in question and reminded them of the standard company policy when it comes to using unsupported technology at work. Instead, we chose to look at this as an opportunity and reevaluated our technology environment.
<br />
<br />
We decided to go with Google Apps for Business for a number of reasons. First, Apps requires much less support than our previous solution. Simply by going Google, we cut our IT support calls by approximately 30 percent, which saved us money and freed up our IT department for other tasks. The second reason was cost. By switching to Google we cut our email costs by approximately one-third, which is a lot, especially when you consider we’re getting access to a much better, more modern product. Lastly, the switch itself was seamless. By working with Google Apps Reseller GPartner, we were able to continue to manage and run our business without missing a beat, while GPartner handled the switch in approximately 45 days.
<br />
<br />
Google Apps gives us a more modern, robust and flexible platform at a third of the cost and frees up our tech support resources. It also allows us to do what’s most important: focus on our business. The only drawback is I wish we would have made the move sooner.</div><div class=\"feedflare\">

<br />
Simple data analytics can sometimes seem like a misnomer. Technology that’s simple for engineers and IT may add complexity to business processes. And the inverse can be true for implementing agile analytics into traditional Business Intelligence (BI) systems. We often hear from customers in industries--ranging from retail to hospitality--that highly skilled teams struggle to deliver what the organization really needs: actionable and data-driven business insights.<br />
<br />
Today we’ve added some new capabilities to <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/big-query\">Google BigQuery</a> that will give your business new ways to work effectively with large amounts of data.<br />
<br />
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-reference#joins\">Big JOIN</a>: use SQL-like queries to join very large datasets at interactive speeds</li>
<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-reference#groupby\">Big Group Aggregations</a>: perform groupings on large numbers of distinct values&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-reference#timestampfunctions\">Timestamp</a>: native support for importing and querying Timestamp data&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />
With these capabilities, you will now be able to join and perform aggregate analysis on multi-terabyte datasets using SQL-like queries or integrated 3rd party tools, instead of having to initiate complex coding projects.<br />
<br />
We’ve been using this technology within Google. For example, when our App Engine team needed to reconcile app billing and usage information, Big JOIN allowed the team to merge 2TB of usage data with 10GB of configuration data in 60 seconds. Big Group Aggregations enabled them to immediately segment those results by customer.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;\">Using the integrated Tableau client the team was able to quickly visualize and detect some unexpected trends.</span><br />
<br />
Pricing remains the same: you pay only for the actual data that’s processed by your queries.<br />
<br />
Joining terabyte-sized tables has traditionally been a challenging task for data analysts, requiring sophisticated MapReduce development skills, powerful hardware, or a lot of time--often all three.  Today with BigQuery you can get directly to business insights using SQL-like queries, with far less effort and far greater speed than you could before.<br />

At X-Trade Brokers (XTB), our goal is to give our customers the information they need to make sound financial decisions. Like many industries, technology is playing a bigger role in our industry. We pride ourselves on being technologically advanced for our customers. It’s what they demand, whether its a robust online trading platform, a vibrant mobile ecosystem or the latest, up-to-the second update on a stock price. Now, we’ve decided to run our business on Google Apps.<br />
<br />
We chose Google Apps because we noticed a gap: we were providing our customers with the latest, most cutting edge technologies to manage their money we weren't doing the same for hundreds of our employees. Our previous solution, Microsoft Outlook, was an on-premise solution. It became too difficult to run a modern, fast-paced brokerage firm on yesterday’s technology - we weren’t providing the tools that our employees needed to keep up. With Google Apps, our employees will have access to information anytime, anywhere from any connected device, allowing them to work how and from where they please. Tools like Google Sites and Google Drive will give our employees the most modern tools available so they can serve our clients in the most efficient way possible.
<br />
<br />
Google Apps offers a suite of tools we didn’t have access to before. Being in a highly regulated industry means we have to take extra precautions to ensure we save and store sensitive employee information such as email and chat records. On other platforms, this is cumbersome and requires a lot of work on both the IT side and employee side. With Google Apps Vault, that happens in the background, giving us both an enterprise-class way to store our most important information as well as a solution that doesn't get in the way. Our IT department is really looking forward to not having to store and manage this data. Many of our employees have grown up with the web and were already familiar with tools such as Gmail and Google Calendar which will make the transition seamless.
<br />
<br />
In the financial services industry, speed is everything -- trading on information that’s even five minutes old can result in a risky investment. Our customers demand real-time information so they can make some of the most important decisions in their lives. With our previous technology solution, I always felt as if we were making a bet on old information but now, with the help of Google, our stock is at an all-time high.

<br />
Founded in Switzerland in 1912, Holcim has become one of the world's leading suppliers of cement and aggregates. The Group also supplies ready-mix concrete and asphalt, and provides related services. We have production sites in about 70 countries on every continent - we’re more spread out globally than any other building materials group.
<br />
<br />
This business and geographical diversity gives us many advantages, but it also means that cross-functional and cross-regional communication and collaboration can be challenging. To meet this challenge and to unify the many such platforms in use across the Group, Holcim’s Executive Committee decided to roll-out Google Apps worldwide to our 40,000 IT users. We chose Google Apps because it will help us concentrate on our core businesses, and bring our employees, customers and partners across the globe closer together.
<br />
<br />
The introduction of Google Apps in our company over the coming years is aligned with the goals of the Holcim Leadership Journey, an initiative to promote customer excellence, increase operational efficiency and develop talent. Collaboration and the global spread of experiences and expertise will be easier, faster, and more efficient, in real-time and from anywhere via mobile and desktop devices. Over time, we believe Google Apps will help to create stronger relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners by directly involving them in online discussions, idea exchange and project work. Also, the innovative and interactive electronic workspaces Google Apps provides will help Holcim attract future generations of young talents to the Group.
<br />
<br />
In addition to the suite of communications and collaboration, we are going to set up three other Google Enterprise solutions: Google Search Appliance, Google App Engine, and Google Apps Vault, an add-on for Google Apps, which will help manage and archive all email data. With the introduction of Google Enterprise products, we are embracing modern cloud-based delivery models that ease the technical complexities of internal operations. Such a model takes away the technical complexities of internal operations and instead allows IT personnel to focus on closer involvement with their business counterparts in creating deeper business value.
<br />
<br />
The roll-out of Google Apps to Holcim Group companies will start in the summer of 2013. Google Apps will enable better collaboration and drive innovation around the world. We are excited to embark on this cultural change that will allow our employees to bring the tools they know and use in their personal lives into the workplace on Google Apps.

It’s not every day that you get to work in the same spot where Samuel Adams brought Bostonians together on the eve of the Boston Tea Party or where George Washington toasted the United States of America on its first birthday. As the Marketing Director at Faneuil Hall Marketplace, I help carry the legacy of America’s first marketplace forward.
<br />
<br />
Faneuil Hall is entrenched in its rich past, but part of my job is to make sure it also stays modern. We’ve recently started adding programs that reflect a new, more innovative and independent spirit: on top of the bustling retail space we’re historically known for, we’ve also hosted local musicians, NBC’s <i>The Today Show</i>, an LED light and sound show, pilates bootcamps and the Urban RAID obstacle course race. And each new day brings another new idea.
<br />
<br />
Coordinating all these activities requires a lot of communication and organization. It also requires a reliable technology platform - something we didn’t have until we moved to Google Apps last year. I remember the night I knew we had to switch. I was working late on a project, when all of the sudden I got a notification that my mailbox was full. I’d been using Gmail for my personal email and knew it would be a better solution for our team not only for storage, but for the rest of the tools in the suite.
<br />
<br />
Getting Apps up and running was a snap. I’m no IT expert, but setting the team up with email and teaching them how to use Calendar, Drive and Docs was simple. In our first week, we set up a shared calendar to track our street performers, visiting artists, and events, so now everyone can see what's going on and when.
<br />
<br />
Apps doesn’t just help us stay organized – it also helps us work better together when we’re away from our desks. Just a few weeks ago, I was doing an on-site walk-through for an upcoming mural when a reporter called looking for pictures for an upcoming article. I jumped on my phone, opened the Drive app, and with just a few clicks, gave her access to the photo folder I had created for press inquiries.
<br />
<br />
I may not be an American Revolutionary, but I still get to help bring millions of people together at one of the country’s most revered landmarks. And thanks to Google Apps, we have the tools to keep our 271-year-old building in the 21st century.

As Japan’s largest airline, operating around 1,000 flights per day, we know a thing or two about clouds. Today we’re delighted to announce that we’ll be embarking on a journey to a cloud of a very different kind — with Google’s cloud based tools <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/enterprise/apps/business/\">Google Apps for Business</a>  — to communicate and collaborate more easily.
<br />
<br />
Starting in April, all our 33,000 staff across 40 company divisions,  from pilots and cabin attendants to HR and finance staff, will use Gmail, Google Drive and Google Talk.
<br />

<br />
As a global business, we have people working all over the world. Now it doesn't matter if our staff are on tarmacs in Tokyo, offices in London, or on-the-go in the streets of Beijing, they’ll be able to communicate and collaborate in real time, using Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides from their PCs, smartphones or tablets. As well as removing the barriers of distance, the move to Google Apps will also help us break down language barriers with <a href=\"http://support.google.com/chat/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=172257\">Google Talk’s translation feature</a>.

Google Apps offers us the reliability and scalability we need. We coordinate flights for 2.7 million passengers to 81 local and international destinations every year, so it is critical we have a communication system that we can rely on. With Gmail we’ll not only have this reliability and scale, we’ll also no longer have to dedicate resources to maintaining and operating our email system as we can rely on Google’s infrastructure.

<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Today’s guest blogger is Mr. Aramaki, Director of Innovation, All Nippon Airways (ANA) Japan. See what other organizations that have gone Google <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/customers.html#utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=en-na-us-entblog-Shaw12052012&amp;utm_campaign=en_us\">have to say</a>.</i>

<br />
As Japan’s largest airline, operating around 1,000 flights per day, we know a thing or two about clouds. Today we’re delighted to announce that we’ll be embarking on a journey to a cloud of a very different kind — with Google’s cloud based tools <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/enterprise/apps/business/\">Google Apps for Business</a>  — to communicate and collaborate more easily.
<br />
<br />
Starting in April, all our 33,000 staff across 40 company divisions,  from pilots and cabin attendants to HR and finance staff, will use Gmail, Google Drive and Google Talk.
<br />
<br />

<br />
As a global business, we have people working all over the world. Now it doesn't matter if our staff are on tarmacs in Tokyo, offices in London, or on-the-go in the streets of Beijing, they’ll be able to communicate and collaborate in real time, using Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides from their PCs, smartphones or tablets. As well as removing the barriers of distance, the move to Google Apps will also help us break down language barriers with <a href=\"http://support.google.com/chat/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=172257\">Google Talk’s translation feature</a>.

<br />
<br />
The Information Services team for the City of Monterey is dedicated to providing the right resources and support for our workforce. We were using an aging and expensive Novell GroupWise email platform that held us back. We faced high overhead costs, a burdensome system administration, lack of innovation, no ability to collaborate and issues around integrating with other key data systems.
<br />
<br />
We spent a lot of time troubleshooting GroupWise problems: applying software updates to servers and clients, monitoring disk space usage, spam filter maintenance, troubleshooting server errors and connections to mobile devices and providing specialized user training. This time would have been better spent building our library of support resources for city employees.
<br />
<br />
After a thorough evaluation of multiple replacement options, our IT department recommended, and our City Council approved, the purchase Google Apps for Government and associated services from Google reseller SADA Systems.
<br />
<br />
With help from SADA Systems, we moved all 460 employees in just 90 days, finishing in early January 2013. SADA provided an excellent project plan, project manager and technical assistance. I truly believe that without SADA’s assistance, this transition would not have been as easy and successful.
<br />
<br />
Our chief reasons for Going Google were low cost, 24/7 availability and security, ability to collaborate, minimal user training needed, and access to our data across different types of applications and mobile devices. We also appreciated Google’s conversion tools, which allowed us to migrate all our existing e-mail, calendar, and contact information with ease and minimize disruption to employees.
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind: Monterey has dozens of offices located across the city and in the neighboring communities we support. It’s not just City Hall where our citizens go to get things done. We have public safety professionals, public works employees, employees with multiple types of mobile devices, fire stations, and service desks in different offices and nearby cities. The coordination and communication challenges in this distributed and decentralized environment were daunting, to say the least.
<br />
<br />
Today, city employees in these dispersed locations communicate using Gmail, share documents in Drive, use Google’s instant messaging, and Sites to stay coordinated. We’re also piloting Google+ Hangouts as another way to streamline collaboration and communication among the different offices. Just recently our five fire stations, located in three different cities, successfully held their staff meeting in a Google+ Hangout.
<br />
<br />
Switching to Google Apps will save the City 30 percent in IT costs over the next five years. The Information Services team can spend more time on implementing new technological solutions across the city. Even more important, this transition has empowered employees to do their jobs faster and with greater ease and efficiency, in turn, benefiting our citizens.

<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Our guest blogger this week is Mark Prestipino, Envista CEO.  Looking for ways to provide enhanced map capabilities to its utilities customers, Envista talks about integrating Google Maps Engine into its IRIS technology.  See what other organizations that have gone Google <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/earthmaps/customers.html\">have to say</a>.</i>
<br />
<br />
With miles and miles of underground pipeline and transmission lines to manage, the ability for our utility customers to quickly locate and keep track of their assets is vital to running a successful operation. Thanks to Google Maps Engine, we've been able to create a powerful map platform that makes this all possible.
<br />
<br />
IRIS, our newest solution for the utility industry, is a cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technology that allows an organization to develop custom map applications without the need for complex coding. Incorporating an organization’s business and location data into a single platform, IRIS apps provides the location-relevant information needed to efficiently maintain critical assets in the field.
<br />
<br />

<br />
The secret behind our IRIS technology is Google Maps Engine, which gives our customers three key benefits:<br />
<br />
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li><b>Scale</b>: Founded on Google’s core infrastructure, Google Maps Engine provides IRIS users with unrivaled scale and reliability. This enables the information and image-processing power needed to store, manage and publish maps with layers and layers of high resolution geospatial data.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Familiarity</b>: IRIS apps users can see their data visualized on a Google Map. This simple user interface -- combined with the incredible, up-to-date imagery of Google Earth -- lets people build their own map applications and understand what they see on a map with very little training.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Mobility</b>: With pipeline and asset management primarily taking place in the field, access to map data anytime, anywhere is critical. The Google Maps Engine cloud platform allows IRIS maps to be used in almost any environment -- mobile, remote or offline.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Maps are an invaluable tool for the utilities industry -- and so is scalable, simple-to-use technology. When it comes to providing our utilities customers with a map solution they can rely on, Google Maps Engine is the clear choice for us.

<li><b>Familiarity</b>: IRIS apps users can see their data visualized on a Google Map. This simple user interface -- combined with the incredible, up-to-date imagery of Google Earth -- lets people build their own map applications and understand what they see on a map with very little training.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Mobility</b>: With pipeline and asset management primarily taking place in the field, access to map data anytime, anywhere is critical. The Google Maps Engine cloud platform allows IRIS maps to be used in almost any environment -- mobile, remote or offline.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Maps are an invaluable tool for the utilities industry -- and so is scalable, simple-to-use technology. When it comes to providing our utilities customers with a map solution they can rely on, Google Maps Engine is the clear choice for us.

Classic Cinemas has been bringing families, couples, kids and film enthusiasts together in front of the silver screen for more than thirty years – around the time Christopher Reeve donned the famous tights and cape for “Superman” in 1978. Over the years, we’ve grown to 500 employees and over 13 movie theaters in and around Chicago. We’ve also outgrown the film technology we started with. After years of using 35-millimeter film projection systems, we upgraded to 4K Ultra High-Def Digital Projectors. We’re a true 21st century cinema.<br />
<br />
When I joined the IT department in 2012, it was clear we were in need of another upgrade – this time, from our Microsoft Exchange server. We had ongoing issues with downtime that cost the company a lot of money and the IT team a lot of time. We looked into cloud-based systems and Google Apps was exactly what we needed – the 99.9 percent uptime sold us.
<br />
<br />
We switched to Google Apps with the help of <a href=\"http://www.cloudsherpas.com/\">Cloud Sherpas</a> in August 2012 and couldn’t have been in better hands. At no point did we ever have a question that they couldn't answer. Data migration? They walked us through each step along the way and made sure we didn't lose a single megabyte. Change management? They ran webinars for all of our employees about moving from Outlook to Gmail, Word to Docs and Folders to Labels. They made switching feel seamless.
<br />
<br />
We created an employee intranet on Google Sites that houses all our necessary documents – employee schedules, upcoming screenings, movie schedules and parking lists, among others. This means everything important sits in one single place, and everyone on the team can access it. No more wild goose chases over email and no more bothering groups of people with email barrages.
<br />
<br />
Google Apps also helped us bring our maintenance request system up to date. Before we switched over, people wrote out their problems in a Word doc and emailed them to us, then we printed them out, tracked them on a bulletin board, and took them down one by one as the maintenance team went on-site to handle each issue. With Cloud Sherpas’ help, we built a Google Form on our intranet, so now everyone submits their requests online. The Form automatically feeds into a spreadsheet, which alerts the maintenance team that work needs to be done. We’ve been able to dramatically reduce administration time and boost our productivity to a new level. We now have complete history and statistics capabilities, as well as the ability to identify trends and be more proactive.
<br />
<br />
Just as digital technology helped us move into the modern era of film, Google Apps has helped us adapt to the future of business. It’s been a smash hit for us - just like “Superman” was back in the day.

Egan Construction is an approximately 800-person construction company in Minnesota currently working on the Central Corridor Light Rail, the biggest construction project in the history of the North Star State. The Light Rail will stretch 11 miles through five major areas of interest, and is expected to be done in 2014. As CIO of Egan, I want to provide my organization with technology that helps connect the job site with the main office, the tools and parts warehouses and our executives.
<br />
<br />
A year ago, we were looking for a solution that would avoid having a fleet of expensive, quickly outdated and slow Microsoft Windows laptops that constantly break or need replacing. I’ve heard stories from other construction firms that Monday mornings were like the movie Groundhog Day, with the IT team tackling the same four-foot high stack of malware-infected laptops over and over while work ground to a halt. I didn’t want to experience that.
<br />
<br />
After surveying the market, we decided to move to Chromebooks for our 140-person foreman staff. They’re lightweight, turn on and off in an instant, and provide easy access to business apps that we use every day.
<br />
<br />
Chromebooks also integrate nicely with Google Apps, which we use to run our business in the field. The workers love the Chromebooks because they aren’t afraid to use them on the job. If one does get damaged, we can swap it out for another one in a matter of minutes, with zero time wasted or data lost. Also, we’ve saved so much in moving forward with Chromebooks instead of Windows laptops - about $200 per machine.
<br />
<br />
Rolling out Chromebooks to our staff was extremely easy. We have two people and an intern in our IT support department, and I wanted the intern to manage the deployment process. I figured he’d only get so far, then my IT guys would have to jump in, but he did it all on his own. If I would have rolled out the same number of Windows laptops, I would have had to hire additional staff just to manage that. And with Chromebooks, we haven’t been plagued with ongoing support requests.
<br />
<br />
The scale of the light rail project really brings to light how valuable the Chromebooks have become to our organization. At Egan, we take pride in the fact that we’re building something that so many Minnesotans will use. The light rail will bring people together that didn’t have an easy way to connect previously. I like to think Chromebooks have done the same for Egan.

Every day, millions of companies, schools and governments around the world run their organizations on Google’s enterprise solutions, including Google Apps, the Google Search Appliance, Google Maps and Earth, and Google Cloud Platform. We’re committed to helping these organizations succeed, but we can’t do it alone; our partners play a crucial role in ensuring customers get the most out of the technology they use. Companies rely on our partners to provide everything from hands-on deployment and technical support to customized applications that integrate seamlessly with Google’s products.
<br />
<br />
Today, we kicked off our inaugural Global Partner Summit at our headquarters in Mountain View, CA. More than 400 partner leaders from around the world are joining us for three days of training, planning and sharing best practices. We’ll also take time at the Summit to recognize the great work that so many of our partners have done helping businesses embrace new solutions and move to the cloud.
<br />
<br />
Googlers joining our partners this week to discuss the state and future of business technology include Vint Cerf, Google’s Chief Internet Evangelist; Patrick Pichette, Google’s Chief Financial Officer; Urs Hölzle, Senior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure; Amit Singh, President of Google Enterprise.

To help partners build their expertise and prepare for certification exams, we’re launching a partner university. The university will feature a combination of self-guided online courses, instructor-led online courses, and in-person classes that can be taken individually or sequentially. We’re also doing more to recognize outstanding resellers across different products. Two years ago, we began recognizing certain Google Apps resellers as <a href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/06/google-reseller-program-sets-new.html\">premier resellers</a>. Today, we’re adding similar ‘premier’ designations for our top partners in our Search Reseller Program and our brand new Maps for Business Reseller Program.

Finally, for their expertise and dedication to meeting customers’ business and technology needs, we’d like to congratulate our 2012 Global partners of the year:<br />

<i><b>Editor's note:</b> Our guest blogger this week is Peter Hutterer, Content Manager at <a href=\"http://www.post.at/\">Österreichische Post AG</a>, Austria’s leading logistics and postal service provider.</i><br />
<br />
<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dw353zCfpQU/USZqHdI0-CI/AAAAAAAABWU/VCLqh1MWK_M/s1600/POST_4C_POSITIV.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img align=\"left\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dw353zCfpQU/USZqHdI0-CI/AAAAAAAABWU/VCLqh1MWK_M/s320/POST_4C_POSITIV.jpg\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" /></a>Österreichische Post AG is the leading logistics and postal service provider in Austria with about 20.000 employees. More than eight million Austrians trust us every day to deliver their letters, advertising materials and packages securely and quickly. As a stock market listed company, we make an important contribution towards maintaining and securing the communication and logistics infrastructure in Austria. We always look to the latest technologies to further enhance the quality of our service, and are convinced that good service is only possible if our customers, employees and partners can find what they are looking for quickly and easily.
<br />
<br />
That is why we chose to implement the Google Search Appliance 7.0. The recently launched project – first implementing GSA for our website and online shop pages and later using it for our intranet – is expected to be completed by mid-2013. Then, 9,000 employees across Austria will use the GSA, which will allow them to locate internal information and documents, share these with the entire workforce and improve our internal networking.
<br />
<br />
The personalized intranet search experience enabled by the GSA is another key factor that played a role in the decision to go with Google’s Enterprise Search solution. With the GSA, we can also search within the organisation for experts in different subject areas, and thus tap into the “wisdom of many” across all our locations to execute our work. In addition, while up to now we've been using various search engines within the company, the move to one and intuitive GSA will lower our IT spend.
<br />
<br />
However, GSA doesn’t just give our employees a fast and easy search experience that yields the most relevant results; our customers also benefit from our implementation of the Google search solution. They are used to finding everything they need extremely fast by searching on Google.at. And now the GSA will give them the same experience on our website, making it easier to navigate the jungle of our diverse service portfolio, including information about package rates, mail forwarding services, e-letters, store locations and more. The GSA helps people find the right information faster and delivers the most relevant results for their queries.  What’s more, with the GSA, our IT staff can better analyze customer search queries, which, in turn, lets them design the website to be more user-friendly. But that’s not the end of it: in the future, we will use GSA to better calibrate our service offers to make sure we meet and exceed the needs of our customers.

<br />
Support is as important as product features when choosing a platform for your applications. And let’s face it, sometimes we all need a bit of help. No matter which <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform</a> services you are using—App Engine, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, etc.—or what time of day, you should be able to get the answers you need. While you can go to Stack Overflow or Google Groups, we realize some of you may need 24x7 coverage, phone support or direct access to a Technical Account Manager team.
<br />
<br />
To meet your support requirements, we’re introducing a comprehensive collection of support packages for services on Google Cloud Platform, so you can decide what level best fits your needs:<br />
<br />
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li><b>Bronze</b>: All customers get access to online documentation, community forums, and billing support. (Free)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Silver</b>: In addition to Bronze, you can email our support team for questions related to product functionality, best practices, and service errors. ($150/month)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Gold</b>: In addition to Silver, you'll receive 24x7 phone support and consultation on application development, best practices or architecture for your specific use case. (Starts at $400/month)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Platinum</b>: The most comprehensive and personalized support. In addition to Gold, you’ll get direct access to a Technical Account Manager team. (<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/support/signup\">Contact Sales</a> for more information)</li>

Support is as important as product features when choosing a platform for your applications. And let’s face it, sometimes we all need a bit of help. No matter which <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform</a> services you are using—App Engine, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, etc.—or what time of day, you should be able to get the answers you need. While you can go to Stack Overflow or Google Groups, we realize some of you may need 24x7 coverage, phone support or direct access to a Technical Account Manager team. 
<br />
<br />
To meet your support requirements, we’re introducing a comprehensive collection of support packages for services on Google Cloud Platform, so you can decide what level best fits your needs:<br />
<br />
<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">
<li><b>Bronze</b>: All customers get access to online documentation, community forums, and billing support. (Free)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Silver</b>: In addition to Bronze, you can email our support team for questions related to product functionality, best practices, and service errors. ($150/month)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Gold</b>: In addition to Silver, you'll receive 24x7 phone support and consultation on application development, best practices or architecture for your specific use case. (Starts at $400/month)&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Platinum</b>: The most comprehensive and personalized support. In addition to Gold, you’ll get direct access to a Technical Account Manager team. (<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/support/signup\">Contact Sales</a> for more information)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/support/signup\">Sign up</a> or click <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/support/packages\">here</a> to find out more information about the new Google Cloud Platform support options.

Increasingly primary, secondary, and university students and faculty are using  Google Apps for Education, a free suite of productivity tools designed to help people work together better.  This also include three top-tier universities in Australia who are going back to school this year with Google Apps. The universities of Griffith, Macquarie and Monash join the community of thousands of institutions worldwide using Google Apps for Education to enhance their students’ learning and to increase organizational efficiency.  This community includes 72 of the top 100 schools in the USA and 20 million students and teachers worldwide.<br />
<br />
Griffith University is a leading research university with a strong international focus spread over 5 campuses.  They were looking for an easy-to-use communication and collaboration platform that offered more storage capacity and a better user interface, regardless of access device or location.<br />
<br />
Monash University has a presence in Malaysia, South Africa, India, Italy and China, and benefits from being able to streamline communication among its dispersed students and staff.<br />

Macquarie University was in fact the first university in Australia, and amongst the first in the world, to offer Gmail to their students, setting up 68,000 accounts back in 2007.  Since then, they have switched on more and more of the suite’s features, and in 2012 even became the first Australian university to map its campus 3 dimensionally in Google Earth.<br />

It may sound obvious, but sometimes the best way to find something is to start looking. Beginning today, Google Drive will let you quickly preview more than <a href=\"http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2423485\">30 file types</a> and quickly flip between files until you find the one you want.
<br />
<br />
You’ll see the new preview automatically if you open a photo, video, or PDF. To see a preview of a Google document, right-click on the file name and select “preview.” Once the preview window is open, you can click on the arrows on either side to flip to other files. And right from within the preview, you can watch video files or scroll through multi-page documents.

Rolling green hills, a skyline of trees and no traffic in sight. Yes, this is Thailand. Today in partnership with the prestigious Mae Fah Luang University, we’re supporting an educational institution famous for its breathtaking natural environment in their vision to become a Green University by going Google.

ICOM Productions is a 100-person company focused on helping companies better engage and develop their employees by freshening up their training programs. We pride ourselves on being progressive, young and vibrant; we encourage our employees to question old habits, push the envelope and change the way we teach and learn every day.
<br />
<br />
When I joined as VP of Operations less than a year ago, I was shocked by how our progressive mentality clashed with our old, slow and unreliable technology. We were using a piecemeal technology solution built around Microsoft® Exchange that made everyday processes disjointed and inefficient. We wanted employees from each of our three offices to be able to collaborate on projects, but the process of emailing versions back and forth and editing them in silos wasn't quite the collaboration we were looking for. We knew we needed something better, but upgrading to the newest Exchange Server would have cost us a fortune and still leave us three years behind the latest technology.
<br />
<br />
It turned out that our forward-thinking employees were pushing the envelope with technology on the side, too: they'd started using their personal Google accounts at work. They were sharing files through Google Drive and creating project hubs with Google Sites. Over the next few months, we talked with our employees and <a href=\"http://www.agosto.com/\">Agosto</a>, a Google Apps Reseller, and we came to a clear conclusion: moving ICOM to Google Apps was the best path forward. In the Fall of 2012, Agosto partnered with our technical team to put a migration plan in place, and 30 days later, all 100 employees were on Apps. It was the fastest IT implementation I’ve ever done.
<br />
<br />
Google+ Hangouts have completely revolutionized our recruiting process. Instead of relying on phone screenings, which don’t really convey a candidate’s personality, or flying people to Calgary, which is expensive, we use Hangouts, which cost nothing and bring each prospect’s character to life. We like to do group interviews via Hangouts to see how people think and interact - group collaboration is huge at ICOM, and you get a good sense of that over video conference. Our candidates love that we’re using new technology and we love that we’re still getting the same valuable insight about our candidates.
<br />
<br />
Google Apps has helped us be more efficient, more forward-thinking and more cost-effective. It’s also helped us strengthen the ICOM culture we pride ourselves on - being creative, asking thought-provoking questions and working as a team. All of this, of course, means that we’re getting better at what we do: helping other companies teach and train their employees more effectively. Just like what Apps has done for us.</div>

At Prudential Georgia Realty, our associates work hard to deliver valuable services to their clients.  Their work ethic and great skills have helped us become the largest real estate company in the Greater Metro Atlanta area. We were <a href=\"http://www.atlrealestatescoop.com/realtrends-recognizes-pgr-as-one-of-top-17-brokerages-in-the-nation/\">recently named by REALTrends</a> as one of only 17 real estate companies in the country to increase its sales volume, agent headcount and agent productivity over the last 10 years.
<br><br>
With more than 1,000 agents in 22 offices, spread out over 43 counties around Atlanta, it is critical for our agents and staff to communicate efficiently with current and potential clients. Communication is the backbone of our business - our agents have to manage a lot of contacts, files, photos and other information and they need access on their mobile devices. We had two separate email systems, a hosted Microsoft® Exchange 2007 server for employees and an open source solution for our agents. We wanted to migrate to a single system that allowed us to support the transition to a more virtual working environment and foster better collaboration internally. Another consideration was the ability for our agents to organize and manage their contacts into groups so they could run campaigns and stay in contact using any of their devices. After a careful evaluation, we decided to move to the Google Apps platform.
<br><br>
We migrated the employees to Google Apps in December and have already seen an improvement in our communication. When our agents go live, Google Apps will help them run their business from any location using any device. Google Groups will let agents easily organize and manage their client and contact lists, so with one click they can send more relevant marketing content to a specific group of people. Most importantly, since it’s all in the cloud, these Groups will automatically sync to any device so the agent can follow up with a personal phone call.
<br><br>
Google Drive allows us to share large files and documents and manage the security at the same time. We plan to implement Google Sites, so each branch or division will have a searchable and sharable place to store information like a high resolution photos. Teams can work together on projects more effectively and collaborate on live documents. Agents will now be able to create personalized Google Sites tailored to specialized groups of prospects like first time buyers, baby boomers, or potential luxury home buyers.
<br><br>
Real estate is a very competitive business. Google Apps puts the information at our fingertips, which gives us a leg up. Leveraging the right technology can be game changing for the real estate industry, and we’re excited to be a leader in that effort.<div class=\"feedflare\">

At Prudential Georgia Realty, our associates work hard to deliver valuable services to their clients.  Their work ethic and great skills have helped us become the largest real estate company in the Greater Metro Atlanta area. We were <a href=\"http://www.atlrealestatescoop.com/realtrends-recognizes-pgr-as-one-of-top-17-brokerages-in-the-nation/\">recently named by REALTrends</a> as one of only 17 real estate companies in the country to increase its sales volume, agent headcount and agent productivity over the last 10 years. 
<br><br>
With more than 1,000 agents in 22 offices, spread out over 43 counties around Atlanta, it is critical for our agents and staff to communicate efficiently with current and potential clients. Communication is the backbone of our business - our agents have to manage a lot of contacts, files, photos and other information and they need access on their mobile devices. We had two separate email systems, a hosted Microsoft® Exchange 2007 server for employees and an open source solution for our agents. We wanted to migrate to a single system that allowed us to support the transition to a more virtual working environment and foster better collaboration internally. Another consideration was the ability for our agents to organize and manage their contacts into groups so they could run campaigns and stay in contact using any of their devices. After a careful evaluation, we decided to move to the Google Apps platform.   
<br><br>
We migrated the employees to Google Apps in December and have already seen an improvement in our communication. When our agents go live, Google Apps will help them run their business from any location using any device. Google Groups will let agents easily organize and manage their client and contact lists, so with one click they can send more relevant marketing content to a specific group of people. Most importantly, since it’s all in the cloud, these Groups will automatically sync to any device so the agent can follow up with a personal phone call.    
<br><br>
Google Drive allows us to share large files and documents and manage the security at the same time. We plan to implement Google Sites, so each branch or division will have a searchable and sharable place to store information like a high resolution photos. Teams can work together on projects more effectively and collaborate on live documents. Agents will now be able to create personalized Google Sites tailored to specialized groups of prospects like first time buyers, baby boomers, or potential luxury home buyers.  
<br><br>
Real estate is a very competitive business. Google Apps puts the information at our fingertips, which gives us a leg up. Leveraging the right technology can be game changing for the real estate industry, and we’re excited to be a leader in that effort.<div class=\"feedflare\">

<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XD56JVJVzKo/URu4W9RxnXI/AAAAAAAABUA/WuvoEW-s_Pk/s1600/USNA+logo.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" ><img border=\"0\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right:10px\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XD56JVJVzKo/URu4W9RxnXI/AAAAAAAABUA/WuvoEW-s_Pk/s320/USNA+logo.jpg\" /></a>
The United States Naval Academy (USNA) has graduated more than 78,000 young men and women to serve in America’s naval service since being founded in 1845. The technological landscape of the country has changed dramatically over the past decade, and USNA has kept pace by providing its students, called midshipmen, with the educational resources required to be effective Navy and Marine Corps officers upon graduation.
<br><br>
Similar to other top educational institutions such as the Ivy League schools, Stanford and MIT, USNA is in constant flux and continuously trying to stay on the technological cutting edge. Thousands of midshipmen enter and depart each year, all requiring mandatory and standardized email addresses and account changes. This presents a significant challenge of ensuring old email accounts are properly deleted and new accounts created quickly. Faculty, staff, and midshipmen rely on a wide array of smartphones and tablets for communication and collaboration.
<br><br>
For years, USNA employed an appliance-based email solution that offered secure communications, but proved to be expensive and limiting over time. USNA paid a hefty license fee for every mobile device accessing email. With the exploding mobile component of the environment, we sought an alternative solution.
<br><br>
During an analytical review of alternatives, USNA discovered the bulk of the 4,400 midshipmen were using personal Gmail accounts. USNA embarked on a trial of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/government/index.html#utm_medium=blog&utm_source=en-na-us-entblog-USNA02132013&utm_campaign=en_us\">Google Apps for Government</a>, providing midshipmen Gmail while allowing USNA to protect school data from uncontrolled exposure to the public domain. It provided a full suite of communication and collaboration tools such as Docs and Calendar. Coincidently, Google Apps for Government also provided universal mobile access with no additional licensing costs.
<br><br>
USNA began with 100 users putting Google Apps through its paces, including testing much needed capabilities like using Calendar to schedule resources like rooms and equipment, and sharing documents for collaborative efforts. Following a successful trial, phase two included applying Google Apps to all faculty, staff, and midshipmen. Today, Google Apps supports approximately 7,200 users at USNA.
<br><br>
We use Gmail the most, with some faculty using its chat feature to communicate with midshipmen for official purposes. USNA maintains roughly four terabytes of mail without the burden of operating onsite storage and backup systems. More and more users are also taking advantage of Docs and Calendar. In fact, the midshipmen and faculty create an average of 5,000 Google Docs daily. Users enjoy the sharing capabilities, enabling greater collaboration. This is enhanced further as Google Apps allows access on any device users choose.
<br><br>
Google Apps provides USNA with flexibility and enables management of the constant change of midshipmen turnover at a lower cost than before. The mobile access alone makes Google Apps a worthwhile investment at $50 per person. It lets us make better use of the taxpayer’s dollars. The greatest value is the ease of creating and sharing information between midshipmen, faculty, and other institutions making Google Apps a core collaborative asset in the educational process.<div class=\"feedflare\">

<a href=\"http://allrecipes.com/\">Allrecipes.com</a> started in 1997, when Tim Hunt couldn’t find his favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe online. He vowed that other cooks like him shouldn’t have to deal with the same problem, and started CookieRecipe.com. From there, he created even more recipe sites that eventually came together into the site we know today: Allrecipes.com. Fifteen years after that cookie baking epiphany, we have more than one million user-generated recipes and 30 million visitors per month. That’s a lot of people looking for more than just chocolate chip treats.
<br><br>
I took over as IT director for Allrecipes.com a year ago, and fixing our aging email system sat at the very top of my first to-do list. We culled our top options—Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Office 365, and Google Apps for Business—and put them through the ringer. After testing, analysis, and focus groups, Google Apps came out on top. With the help of our partner, <a href=\"http://www.cloudsherpas.com/\">Cloud Sherpas</a>, we moved all of Allrecipes.com employees over. Changing old habits is hard, especially when it comes to technology, but after just five months, it feels like Google Apps is second nature to us.
<br><br>
We want all of our employees to be able to work from wherever they are, with whatever device they have with them. With Google Apps, they can do just that - we use a mixture of mobile devices and operating systems, and our teams can switch seamlessly between them. I don’t always have my laptop with me, but with the Google Drive mobile app, I just jump into a doc on my smartphone or tablet to review or edit it, whether it’s during a meeting or on the way to the airport. Needing to fix a document on the fly doesn’t mean needing a computer anymore. We move quickly. Apps moves with us.
<br><br>
Hangouts also help us stay connected. Our social media manager recently moved to Australia, but with Hangouts, it’s almost as if she never left. We have video conferences with her throughout the week, and you wouldn’t know she’s halfway around the world. Our technical teams also use Hangouts for off-hours maintenance. They get excited about being able to see who they’re working with as if they were both in the office, interacting as if they were in person, and sharing their screens to help expedite problem solving. We love that video conferencing is so seamlessly integrated with the entire Apps suite, and we don’t have to use or pay for a separate program.
<br><br>
Food is more than just food – it brings people together and creates shared experiences. At Allrecipes.com, we’re proud to provide so many people with the foundation for those experiences. Google Apps brings our company closer so we can focus on helping home cooks make magic in their kitchens, one cookie or casserole at a time.<div class=\"feedflare\">

<br><br>
Skin care has been our core expertise for 130 years. From our headquarters in Germany, we at Beiersdorf AG market one of the world’s most successful skin care brands: NIVEA. In order to move forward in an industry that we've been in for a long time, it’s important for us to have a finger on the pulse of the market and focus on the ever-changing needs of our customers. Today, more of our customers are using the Internet to find our products and we wanted to make that an easy experience for them.
<br><br>
Google Search Appliance offers visitors to our websites a significantly enhanced experience. It is a scalable hardware solution that offers a Google-like search experience for our public NIVEA websites worldwide. For our users, it offers the same kind of easy, fast and relevant search experience that they know from Google.com, while our company benefits from complete flexibility and control over the online user search experience. That is a great help to us, particularly when it comes to turning potential customers into real ones. We have now rolled out the Google Search Appliance globally for a total of 74 conventional and 12 mobile, country-specific websites of the NIVEA brand.
<br><br>
Google Search Appliance has personalized and improved the visitors’ experience on NIVEA websites: when searching for products, they receive country-specific suggestions and results that also adapt based on patterns in the respective market. For example, if a site visitor in Germany starts his or her search with \"de\", the first suggestion he or she will see is “deo ohne aluminium”, while the same query in France will suggest “devenir testeuse nivea”. So that the search process actually yields successful results, searches in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Dutch and Arabic are supported by extensive features such as integrated thesaurus and an automatic, self-learning spellcheck function. The upshot is that the Google technology now makes it a whole lot easier for our customers to search for content that is relevant to them.

At Hard Rock hotels, we don’t want to be a normal hotel; we want our guests to feel like rock stars from the moment they walk in the door. But, with 1,200 employees that use our IT platform across four locations, it can be challenging to create a consistent guest experience. We need tools that help us make decisions in the moment -- the party doesn’t stop at the Hard Rock!
<br><br>
As the IT Corporate Director of the All Inclusive Collection (which runs all of the Hard Rock Hotels in Mexico and the Dominican Republic), I’m responsible for providing tools to our employees that will let them to work together effectively and focus on our customers. On our old system, Microsoft® Exchange, we had a large datacenter for the hotels to maintain. Our communication tools weren’t flexible enough to make decisions on the go and we couldn’t guarantee that we were running the same promotions at the same time. We worried about the effect on our guests’ experience. I decided that we needed to move to Google Apps and get off of our on-premise infrastructure. Google Apps was fast, safe, and agile and met all of the security standards I was looking for, so I knew that all of our customers’ information would be protected, too!
<br><br>
Since moving to Google Apps, we've improved internal communication and are now spending half as much time on things as we were previously. While our hotels are in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, our sales teams are located all over the globe—North America, Europe, Asia, and here in Latin America—and they’re moving all the time. With Google Talk and Google+ Hangouts, we rarely use the phone anymore, it’s easier to jump on a Hangout from any device and from any of our locations.  When our sales team in Miami make an important reservation for a wedding or a big group, they chat via Google Talk with the hotel in Cancun, providing immediate assurance and confirmation that everything will run smoothly.
<br><br>
Having so many guests across our hotels, problems can arise at anytime day or night, so we can’t have downtime. Rather than worrying about keeping our servers and email running, we spend our time managing tools through a browser. We've saved thousands of dollars in IT infrastructure and telecommunication costs, and my IT headaches are gone. I used to have a team of guys helping me manage servers and keep our email up and running. Now, only two of us manage all of the tools.
<br><br>
Google Sites and Google Calendar have been fundamental in organizing our promotions and standardizing our guest experience by allowing us to share across hotel locations. We just had a promotion across all our branches for Christmas and the holidays. We made a  site with all of the dates, rates, and details of the deal and we could easily monitor how it was rolled out across each hotel. This process used to take weeks, and fixing discrepancies between the locations was messy. Now, it’s simple, consistent, and happens in real time.
<br><br>
On Google Apps, we really feel like a team, working together despite being countries apart. We are able to provide the same level of rockstar service in all of our hotels and create great experiences for our guests. All while improving our customer experience – rock on!<div class=\"feedflare\">

Last year, we <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/tech-tips-that-are-good-to-know.html\">launched</a> <a href=\"http://google.com/goodtoknow\">Good to Know</a>, our biggest-ever campaign focused on making the web a safer, more comfortable place. Today, on Safer Internet Day, we’re updating Good to Know to include more tips and advice to help you protect yourself and your family from identity theft, scams and online fraud. You can also learn how to make your computer or mobile device more secure, and get more out of the web — from searching more effectively to making calls from your computer. And you can find out more about how Google works to make you, your device and the whole web safer.

For example, we encrypt the Gmail and Google Search traffic between your computer and Google -- this protects your Google activity from being snooped on by others. We also make this protection, known as session-wide SSL encryption, the default when you’re signed into Google Drive. Because outdated software makes your computer more vulnerable to security problems, we built the Chrome browser to auto-update to the latest version every time you start it. It gives you up-to-date security protection without making you do any extra work.
<br />
<br />
Even if you don’t use Google, we work hard to make the web safer for you. Every day we identify more than 10,000 unsafe websites — and we inform users and other web companies what we’ve found. We show warnings on up to 14 million Google Search results and 300,000 downloads, telling our users that there might be something suspicious going on behind a particular website or link. We share that data with other online companies so they can warn their users.

<br />
We know staying safe online is important to you — and it is important to us too. That's why we've had independent third parties <a href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/09/google-apps-data-protections-verified.html\">perform inspections and audits</a> for the data protections in Google Apps.
